<h2 id="date:_2014-03-25_18:47:21">date: 2014-03-25 18:47:21</h2><p>I’ve got several links and a few things to say about the Vols advancing to the Sweet 16. First off, I’m <strong>pumped</strong>. These players have all worked hard and deserve it. I loved seeing the energy we saw from Cuonzo Martin. I feel like we know him a little better.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit from an <a href="http://www.footballtime.com/2014/03/24/open-letter-cuonzo-martin/" target="_blank" rel="external">open letter</a> to Cuonzo Martin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were blind to the type of leader you are. We were blind to the love your players have for you. We ignored the quiet work you do in the community—work you do because you care, not because you want to draw attention to yourself. We were blind to your growth as a coach and to your potential.</p>
<p>Yet, here you are in the Sweet 16 leading a team that might be the best story of the tournament. Here you are leading a group of young men who blocked out all our chatter, backed you, and embraced your coaching. You deserve a tremendous amount of credit for keeping this team together. Many coaches would have lost them when the criticism reached deafening levels, but not you. Instead, you got them playing together at just the right time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great stuff and it’s absolutely true. I was someone who was salivating over the idea of <a href="http://chrisbrakebill.com/2014/02/25/bruce-pearl/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bruce Pearl coming back</a>. It wasn’t really fair to Cuonzo Martin.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts from <a href="http://www.tnsportsradio.com/2014/03/24/vol-nation-united-stand/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tennessee Sports Radio</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before this season, Martin had never led the Vols to the NCAA Tournament. That’s a fail, folks, and one need look no further than to Bruce Pearl’s six-year tenure as the Vols’ head coach for confirmation of such. A stretch during which the Tennessee Volunteers punched their ticket to the dance every single season. Three times they danced all the way to the Sweet 16, one of those tangos evolving into the program’s first and only Elite 8 appearance ever. Thanks to Bruce Pearl, NCAA Tournament appearances are now expected in Knoxville. And rightly so.</p>
<p>Which is why Cuonzo Martin came under ever increasing scrutiny this season. For he entered it 0-2 in the only stat that mattered. NCAA Tournament berths…</p>
<p>Therefore, many in Vol Nation believed Cuonzo Martin was a horrible coach. Bruce Pearl was a great one whose show-cause was just about to end. So 36,000 members of Vol Nation signed on the dotted virtual line and made it official. Time for the great coach to replace the horrible one.</p>
<p>The only problem with that is that Cuonzo Martin isn’t a horrible coach. Don’t get me wrong. He certainly hadn’t proven he was a great one. Not by any stretch. A great coach doesn’t put forth a team which underachieves as often as Martin’s team did this year. But calling Martin a horrible coach isn’t accurate, either. A horrible coach doesn’t win 60-plus games in three seasons. A horrible coach doesn’t land five-star recruits like Robert Hubbs III. A horrible coach doesn’t keep a team together when 36,000 fans have officially called for his head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This team looked <em>very</em> different a month ago. There wasn’t much they’d done to give us reason to expect they would play like this. Not consistently. I don’t think at that time you were wrong to think, maybe it’s time for a change back to Bruce Pearl. But this is why you wait until the <em>end</em> of the season to make decisions like this.</p>
<p>I also have confess to being swayed by the show that is Bruce Pearl. He’s enthusiastic. He paints his chest. He makes jokes about bacon. He promises to kick Florida’s ass, and delivers. </p>
<p>Cuonzo is a quiet guy. He doesn’t say more than he needs to. And I absolutely faulted him for that which is unfair. You don’t have to make a show of yourself to be a great coach (see: pretty much every other great coach). And we’ve always known he’s a great man. That’s why we followed up a coach who made questionable decisions with him.</p>
<p>Cuonzo still has a lot to prove. But he’s at the very least proven he can make a sweet 16. He’s got a good chance to do more than that. He’s going to have a challenge ahead next year, but he’s earned the security to show us what else he has up his sleeve. </p>

<p>I have just sorted through the App Store and settled on trying out your app. I open it up and you immediately ask if you can send me Push Notifications? I have no context about what these are going to be used for or why they might be useful to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently got similar advice about my iPhone game. I’d never really thought twice about asking immediately, but it really is an annoying experience. I’m looking for a better time to ask for this than at launch. Possibly when you make your first move. I might even follow David’s advice and make it something you explicitly enable.</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>Do the math and UAB appears to be overestimating the supposed $7.25 million cost of having a football team in 2018-19. In fact, it looks like UAB football is a break-even and/or slightly profitable proposition, without even considering merchandise sales or other, hidden sources of revenue. (For instance, one recent FBS entrant has a $2 million-a-year concession deal with Pepsi, yet credits those revenues to university food services.)</p>

<p>As usual, Andy Schwarz is spot on. Read the whole thing to find out how schools use bad accounting in relation to their athletic departments.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
      
        <p>The good news is we get our first college football playoff this year. The bad news is it’s still a bit imperfect. I can’t seem to find my playoff plan on the internet anymore so I’ll give a quick summary here. </p>
<p>I think college basketball has it mostly right. Conference champions deserve a shot, no matter the conference. In general, if you’re a conference champion you’re a winner. Previously I’ve been a support of 16 teams, but with the total number of conferences down to 10, I’m open to a 12 team playoff. I’m going to frame out what both scenarios would look like.</p>
<h2 id="Conference_Champions">Conference Champions</h2><p>First things first, let’s look at who is getting the automatic bids into our tournament.</p>
<table><tr><td>AAC</td><td>Memphis</td></tr><tr><td>ACC</td><td>FSU</td></tr><tr><td>Big XII</td><td>Baylor</td></tr><tr><td>Big Ten</td><td>Ohio State</td></tr><tr><td>Conference USA</td><td>Marshall</td></tr><tr><td>MAC</td><td>Northern Illinois</td></tr><tr><td>Mountain West</td><td>Boise State</td></tr><tr><td>Pac 12</td><td>Oregon</td></tr><tr><td>SEC</td><td>Alabama</td></tr><tr><td>Sun Belt</td><td>Georgia Southern</td></tr></table>

<h2 id="At_Large_Spots">At Large Spots</h2><p>So we’ve got 10 conference champions that leaves us 2 or 6 at large spots, depending on the playoff format.</p>
<p><strong>Top At-Large Teams</strong><br>TCU, Michigan State, Kansas State, Mississippi State, Georgia Tech, Wisconsin, Missouri, Arizona, Mississippi, Georgia, UCLA</p>
<p>So let’s just rank the top teams here. There’s a lot of debate to be made here, and my goal isn’t to determine the absolute best field but to show off the format. So forgive me if you think my at large picks are dumb</p>
<ol>
<li>TCU</li>
<li>Michigan State</li>
<li>Kansas State</li>
<li>Mississippi</li>
<li>Mississippi State</li>
<li>Arizona</li>
</ol>
<p>TCU and Michigan State are easy. Both teams’ only losses are to teams already in the field. Honestly think Mississippi State had a better season than Ole Miss, but that head to head gives Ole Miss the edge. Both had great seasons in a tough conference.</p>
<p>Kansas State might be the best three loss team in the country. Two losses to top Big XII teams in the field and a close home loss to Auburn. I’m putting them third, partly because they deserve it and partly for better 16 team match ups. Arizona sneaks in despite the rough showing in the Pac 12 title game.</p>
<h2 id="Ranking_the_Field">Ranking the Field</h2><p>So that gives us our field of 12 to 16 teams. Let’s rank all 16 top to bottom. (again these are my rankings and I’m sure <em>many</em> will disagree)</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>16 Team</th><th>12 Team</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Alabama</td><td>1. Alabama</td></tr><tr><td>2. Oregon</td><td>2. Oregon</td></tr><tr><td>3. Florida State</td><td>3. Florida State</td></tr><tr><td>4. Ohio State</td><td>4. Ohio State</td></tr><tr><td>5. Baylor</td><td>5. Baylor</td></tr><tr><td>6. TCU</td><td>6. TCU</td></tr><tr><td>7. Michigan State</td><td>7. Michigan State</td></tr><tr><td>8. Kansas State</td><td>8. Boise State</td></tr><tr><td>9. Mississippi</td><td>9. Marshall</td></tr><tr><td>10. Mississippi State</td><td>10. Northern Illinois</td></tr><tr><td>11. Arizona</td><td>11. Memphis</td></tr><tr><td>12. Boise State</td><td>12. Georgia Southern</td></tr><tr><td>13. Marshall</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>14. Northern Illinois</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15. Memphis</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16. Georgia Southern</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>


<h2 id="The_Brackets">The Brackets</h2><p><img src="/images/real-college-football-playoff/16_team.png" alt="16 Team"></p>
<p><img src="/images/real-college-football-playoff/12_team.png" alt="12 Team"></p>
<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2><p>With the number of conferences down to 10, I think I’m changing my tune a little this year. I’d really prefer the 12 team playoff. I imagine we won’t see any new FBS conferences anytime soon so it’s a safe bet for the future. And I think it creates more competitive first round matchups.</p>
<p>Both formats it would likely mean a reduction in the number of regular season games. I think at least one game would have to be dropped off, but maybe two. Frankly this is my biggest concern, because losing those games could be tough financiallly on a lot of teams. Hopefully a profit share of the playoff games could compensate for that.</p>
<p>So if you dropped off a game, then you would play two rounds at school sites before Christmas and two rounds at neutral site after New Years. There are a lot of logisitics to work out, but rewarding the conference champions will make for a fantastic playoff.</p>

<p>In a related note, the <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/orion/" target="_blank" rel="external">Orion program</a> has me really excited about the future of human space travel. I can’t wait to see what comes of the first test launch tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately it’s hard to call my attempt at NaNoWriMo anything but a failure. I wrote about 6 super short chapters of my “novel” and inertia plus the holidays stopped me in my tracks.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I found each day was my fear before even getting started. I felt like I had already written a bunch of shit and all I could muster up was more of it. I also had this crippling fear of writing myself into a corner. Sticking myself in a position where my story was screwed. The point of NaNoWriMo is to power through this and if you don’t like your plot at the end, you can edit it. But I couldn’t fight off the fear that I was going to write something dumb (this not doing something for the fear that I’ll do it poorly is an all too common story in my life).</p>
<p>I’m thinking about keeping the writing going throughout the year and maybe trying to add to the novel once a week. Nothing to ambitious. Just consistently sticking to the habit, if for nothing else but the habit’s sake.</p>

        <p>One of the things that is driving me crazy about my iPhone is websites in Safari auto redirecting to their native app. This is the kind of thing that seems great in theory, but it results in a really shitty experience. </p>
<p>The primary culprit for me is Pinterest. If I open a link to a board or user or pin on Pinterest, that tab redirects me to the app. Okay cool. I’m logged in in the app. I can check out whatever I was looking at. But if I don’t immediately go close that tab I’m in for trouble the next time I open Safari. The tab will have been purged from memory so it’s reloaded and I’m immediately forced back into the app.</p>
<p>What’s the solution? To me there are two options. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Close the tab. If you’re directing me out of Safari, then I probably want that context to be closed as I move into another. I’m not sure if devs can do this, but if they can’t Apple should do it. The site is taking me to their app, close that Safari tab. This is the simplest solution, but I think there are marginally decent arguments to be made that you don’t want that tab closed in every situation. I think?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provide developers the ability to show a native extension-like popover view that gives some context. For Pinterest it might be some basic board or information with a small photo. Not the stupid little, “Hey we have an app. Go view it” functionality that Apple provides, but a fully native, developer provided view that lets users decide if they want to load the app. No forcing a user out of the browser and into the app.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>We visit yet another cafe. My last request to Slotboom is to show me what he would do if he wanted to really harm me. He asks me to go to Live.com (the Microsoft email site) and enter a random username and password. A few seconds later, the information I just typed appears on his screen. “Now I have the login details of your email account,” Slotboom says. “The first thing I would do is change the password of your account and indicate to other services you use that I have forgotten my password. Most people use the same email account for all services. And those new passwords will then be sent to your mailbox, which means I will have them at my disposal as well.” We do the same for Facebook: Slotboom is able to intercept the login name and password I entered with relative ease.</p>

<p>Why you should think twice about connecting to public WiFi. If you’re going to use an untrusted network, you really should use a secured VPN like <a href="https://www.getcloak.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Cloak</a>.</p>
