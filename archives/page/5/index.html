        <p>I think this is a fantastic shift. Open vacation policies can be difficult to navigate and leave you feeling guilty even when you take a minimum time off. It’s hard to track how much time your coworkers are off, but you always tend to fear looking like you aren’t working. Butts in seats != work. I’m a fan of open vacation policies and shorter work weeks. Not just because it makes life a little easier, but I think at the very least, it doesn’t reduce productivity.</p>

<p>Great stuff from Shawn Blanc. I’m thinking on this as I debate what to do with my journal once I’m done with the 31 day prompt list I’m following from Art of Manliness.</p>
<p>I think what I want to do is in the vein of Shawn’s Core Curriculum. I want to compile a fairly small list of questions that inspect the various important areas of my life. What did you learn about marriage today? How did you experience God? What inspired your work? In the future, what did you learn about fatherhood? How did you fail or succeed financially?</p>
<p>I’d like a list of maybe 10 or so questions to choose from. And each day I’ll pick one from the list. Whatever question lines up with an experience I had. I need to make sure I word the questions so that they’re scoped well and feel answerable.</p>
<p>Definitely going to stew on this through the end of January…</p>

<p>The thing is, that “they chose this route” defense doesn’t work in antitrust.

<p>I’m a software developer who uses video games to unwind. Officially, I think, this makes me the kind of person many people imagine would be waiting with bated breath for some kind of ubiquitous, brain implanted computer. I will admit, I do have what I consider a serious addiction to information acquisition — books were a gateway drug. However, my boundary between digital and analog is extremely definitive. Where most people see digital and analog as opposing forces, and one easily annihilating the other, I always see two different but complementary tools. I wouldn’t eat soup with a knife, nor would I cut a steak with a spoon.</p>

        <p>I recently shared some of the <a href="/2015/01/01/2014-in-Review/">things</a> I’m digging from 2014 going into 2015. I wanted to take some time to share a few more things. Specifically I wanted to share some things I pay for that I could probably get for free.</p>
<h2 id="Fastmail_-_$10-40/year_per_user"><a href="http://www.fastmail.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Fastmail</a> - $10-40/year per user</h2><p>Sure I could use Gmail or Yahoo Mail or a million other free services, but I prefer to be the customer not the product. Fastmail focuses on <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/help/ourservice/security.html" target="_blank" rel="external">security</a> and <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/about/privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="external">privacy</a>. The web app is every bit as good as Gmail but with no pesky ads. They use all the email standards, so you can use whatever desktop and/or mobile client you prefer.</p>
<p>Beyond all that you get calendar and contacts syncing, file storage with FTP &amp; WebDAV access, website &amp; photo gallery creation, XMPP chat, etc etc. I don’t think I’ve even taken advantage of everything Fastmail can do in my life. I <em>absolutely</em> recommend them to everyone. They will be powering my family’s email for many years to come.</p>
<h2 id="Feed_Wrangler/Pod_Wrangler_-_$19/year"><a href="http://www.feedwrangler.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Feed Wrangler/Pod Wrangler</a> - $19/year</h2><p>Back in the day, the only way to do RSS reading was Google Reader. Then Google decided to shut it down and the race was on for products to replace it. I’ve tried several of them, and I settled on Feed Wrangler. I’m a simple user and don’t use most of the advanced features, but there’s a lot of power in the smart streams.</p>
<p>Also as a subscriber to Feed Wrangler I get access to Pod Wrangler, a companion podcast syncing service. It’s a lot of simplicity added to my life for less than $2 a month.</p>
<h2 id="Dropbox_-_$99/year"><a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Dropbox</a> - $99/year</h2><p>I love me some Dropbox. Basically all of my frequently used files are stored, synced, and backed up to Dropbox. All of the photos from my phone are backed up there as well. My only complaint is I wish Dropbox offered a plan somewhere between the free couple of gigabytes and the pro 1 Terabyte plan.</p>
<h2 id="Evernote_-_$45/year"><a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Evernote</a> - $45/year</h2><p>I keep so much in Evernote. Any email I might need in the future gets emailed into Evernote. All my paper bills and major receipts get scanned in. Most of my transfer bandwidth is used by pictures of beautiful homes.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that when it comes to the important web services in your life, you find products you love and are worth paying for. If you take the free and easy option, you likely will be the product not the customer or you won’t have much to complain about when that service gets shut down.</p>

        <p>In case you missed it, Ohio State won the inaugural College Football Playoff last night. In my imaginary world, they were up for one title, and the won it; defeating B1G rival Michigan State 31-28 in the 12 team playoff.</p>
<p>In the 16 team playoff, Michigan State was runner up again losing 35-30 to Ole Miss. Lots of fun and upsets were had along the way. Let’s hope the appetizer that was this 4 team playoff gets expanded to be something more exciting (while still maintaining the importance of the regular season by letting in all conference champs).</p>

<p>Being productive is not what’s ultimately important. I want to do my best creative work and I want to have thriving relationships.</p>
<p>Time management, GTD, focus, diligence — these can help keep me on track. But they are not the end goal in and of themselves. I want to focus first on creativity. What do I need to do my best creative work?</p>
<p>Have I written today? Have I daydreamed? Have I been contemplative? Have I had an inspiring and encouraging conversation? Have I helped somebody? These acts are far more important than the progress I make against my to-do list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One trap I fall into far too frequently is searching for ways to be more productive. Sometimes the best thing to do is to take some time for yourself or for someone else, and you will find yourself with renewed focus and energy for your work.</p>

        <p>Earlier this week, I shared my full list of feeds and podcasts I read and listen to. I wanted to take a few minutes to share my five favorites in each category. I’m sure by the end of the year these five favorites will look completely different</p>
<h2 id="Favorite_Feeds">Favorite Feeds</h2><p><a href="http://www.daringfireball.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Daring Fireball</a><br>John Gruber is one of the better writers out there. His writing tends to be complementary of Apple, but that’s almost completely because he believes Apple products are superior products. He’s pretty smart, for a Cowboys fan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.remodelista.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Remodelista</a><br>Some of the best home design out there. Their style leans strongly in the direction of mine, so I see a lot of stuff I love.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grantland.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Grantland</a><br>Sports and culture collide into something fantastic. I particularly love anything Holly Anderson and Brian Phillips write.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thecramped.com" target="_blank" rel="external">The Cramped</a><br>A website about ‘analog writing’? Seems a bit absurd, but it is fantastic. As someone who has taken more to writing by hand, I love reading about other people’s tools and tactics for better writing.</p>
<p><a href="http://jdbentley.com/journal" target="_blank" rel="external">J.D. Bentley</a><br>‘Writings on southern tradition, culture, and bourbon’. The bourbon bit seems, unfortunately, a bit dishonest, but the rest is fantastic. Some of the most thoughtful writing on the internet. He’s somewhat intermittent with posts, but when he does write expect a busy week of reading.</p>
<h2 id="Favorite_Podcasts">Favorite Podcasts</h2><p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w" target="_blank" rel="external">Back to Work</a><br>I’m forcing myself to only pick one Merlin Mann podcast. Unfortunately for Roderick on the Line, I enjoy Dan Benjamin just a little more than John Roderick. Well today at least. Quality, hilarious, thoughtful talk about so many things in our daily lives. With occasional, long tangents about comics.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.relay.fm/analogue" target="_blank" rel="external">Analog(ue)</a><br>Rather than talking about tech specifically, Casey Liss and Myke Hurley talk about how tech affects our lives. A lot of real stuff here. I love it.</p>
<p><a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/podcast/archive?id=10401253" target="_blank" rel="external">The Moment with Brian Koppelman</a><br>Some of the best interviews with the most interesting people. Brian Koppelman focuses on a moment in people’s lives that lead them to success. But really he gets so much of their lives beyond that moment and it’s fantastic.</p>

        <blockquote>
<p>The aim of net neutrality is to preserve the Internet as the crucial open sidewalk for communication that it has become. The reason that the Chinese, Russian and Cuban governments fear an open Internet more than anything else is that it allows users to gather and speak to one another. But users of a walled-garden “zero-rated” Internet can’t even click links that go outside the garden. And they certainly won’t be launching their own apps. Linking and building are the fundamental attributes of the Internet — innovation and speech without permission — that must not be compromised away.</p>

<p>Among the countries who have banned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-rating" target="_blank" rel="external">zero rating</a> while the US sits on its thumbs (listening to the carrier lobbyists): Chile, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, and Japan. Seems like we should be leaders here, not followers.</p>
