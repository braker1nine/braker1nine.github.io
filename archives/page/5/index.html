        <p>We’ve started using Agile in our team at ESPN, and the experience has made me see just how discombobulated my strategy for working on side projects is. Starting this week, I’m taking some Agile-ish concepts and getting them into my workflow.</p>
<p>One of the problems I have is I’ve got two (well, three, but one has been way on the back burner) projects going on at once and I’m constantly going back and forth on this and that. This context switching from day to day even makes it almost impossible to make real progress.</p>
<p>Each week I’m doing a little sprint. Each sprint will focus on one project. For now I’m just going to cycle through all three projects week by week. Taking away my ability to just hack on the little thing I want to hack on will help me get shit done. If the nature of deadlines or tasks that need to be done requires it, I will adjust my plan a bit. But I want to make sure I’ve got my weeks’ planned well in advance.</p>
<p>I’m pulling my projects and tasks into <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/" target="_blank" rel="external">Omnifocus</a> and doing my planning there. I <em>really</em> want to love Omnifocus, but it feels like the learning curve is so steep. So if you have any tips or workflows for Omnifocus, I’d love to hear them. If it ends up creating too much friction I’ll just move back to <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/" target="_blank" rel="external">Things</a>, which has been my old standby for years now.</p>
<p>Maintaining discipline with a project you work on alone is tough. It’s time to get proactive about my planning.</p>

<p>I’ve come up with something I’m calling ”The Universal Sandwich Theory”. Follow along with me here: A sandwich made with bad ingredients and poorly made bread will be a horrible sandwich. A sandwich made with good ingredients but poorly made bread will be a bad sandwich. A sandwich made with great ingredients but poorly made bread will be a mediocre sandwich. Conversely, a sandwich made with bad ingredients and great bread will be a mediocre sandwich. A sandwich made with good ingredients and great bread will be a great sandwich. A sandwich made with great ingredients and great bread will be a fantastic sandwich. Bread is the most important ingredient of any sandwich. When making a sandwich, focus on getting the best bread you can. It makes whatever is happening in the middle better. (This also applies to way more than sandwiches.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Completely agree. This is why I don’t like standard whole wheat bread. It’s dryness just completely ruins any sandwich for me.</p>
<p>Also definitely applies to burgers. I’ve had a lot of really good burgers (medium rare, with some mayo in case you need to know), but what separates the <em>great</em> ones is the buns.</p>

        <p>I think this is a fantastic shift. Open vacation policies can be difficult to navigate and leave you feeling guilty even when you take a minimum time off. It’s hard to track how much time your coworkers are off, but you always tend to fear looking like you aren’t working. Butts in seats != work. I’m a fan of open vacation policies and shorter work weeks. Not just because it makes life a little easier, but I think at the very least, it doesn’t reduce productivity.</p>

<p>Great stuff from Shawn Blanc. I’m thinking on this as I debate what to do with my journal once I’m done with the 31 day prompt list I’m following from Art of Manliness.</p>
<p>I think what I want to do is in the vein of Shawn’s Core Curriculum. I want to compile a fairly small list of questions that inspect the various important areas of my life. What did you learn about marriage today? How did you experience God? What inspired your work? In the future, what did you learn about fatherhood? How did you fail or succeed financially?</p>
<p>I’d like a list of maybe 10 or so questions to choose from. And each day I’ll pick one from the list. Whatever question lines up with an experience I had. I need to make sure I word the questions so that they’re scoped well and feel answerable.</p>
<p>Definitely going to stew on this through the end of January…</p>

Officially, I think, this makes me the kind of person many people imagine would be waiting with bated breath for some kind of ubiquitous, brain implanted computer. I will admit, I do have what I consider a serious addiction to information acquisition — books were a gateway drug. However, my boundary between digital and analog is extremely definitive. Where most people see digital and analog as opposing forces, and one easily annihilating the other, I always see two different but complementary tools. I wouldn’t eat soup with a knife, nor would I cut a steak with a spoon.</p>

        <p>I recently shared some of the <a href="/2015/01/01/2014-in-Review/">things</a> I’m digging from 2014 going into 2015. I wanted to take some time to share a few more things. Specifically I wanted to share some things I pay for that I could probably get for free.</p>
<h2 id="Fastmail_-_$10-40/year_per_user"><a href="http://www.fastmail.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Fastmail</a> - $10-40/year per user</h2><p>Sure I could use Gmail or Yahoo Mail or a million other free services, but I prefer to be the customer not the product. Fastmail focuses on <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/help/ourservice/security.html" target="_blank" rel="external">security</a> and <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/about/privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="external">privacy</a>. The web app is every bit as good as Gmail but with no pesky ads. They use all the email standards, so you can use whatever desktop and/or mobile client you prefer.</p>
<p>Beyond all that you get calendar and contacts syncing, file storage with FTP &amp; WebDAV access, website &amp; photo gallery creation, XMPP chat, etc etc. I don’t think I’ve even taken advantage of everything Fastmail can do in my life. I <em>absolutely</em> recommend them to everyone. They will be powering my family’s email for many years to come.</p>
<h2 id="Feed_Wrangler/Pod_Wrangler_-_$19/year"><a href="http://www.feedwrangler.net" target="_blank" rel="external">Feed Wrangler/Pod Wrangler</a> - $19/year</h2><p>Back in the day, the only way to do RSS reading was Google Reader. Then Google decided to shut it down and the race was on for products to replace it. I’ve tried several of them, and I settled on Feed Wrangler. I’m a simple user and don’t use most of the advanced features, but there’s a lot of power in the smart streams.</p>
<p>Also as a subscriber to Feed Wrangler I get access to Pod Wrangler, a companion podcast syncing service. It’s a lot of simplicity added to my life for less than $2 a month.</p>
<h2 id="Dropbox_-_$99/year"><a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Dropbox</a> - $99/year</h2><p>I love me some Dropbox. Basically all of my frequently used files are stored, synced, and backed up to Dropbox. All of the photos from my phone are backed up there as well. My only complaint is I wish Dropbox offered a plan somewhere between the free couple of gigabytes and the pro 1 Terabyte plan.</p>
<h2 id="Evernote_-_$45/year"><a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Evernote</a> - $45/year</h2><p>I keep so much in Evernote. Any email I might need in the future gets emailed into Evernote. All my paper bills and major receipts get scanned in. Most of my transfer bandwidth is used by pictures of beautiful homes.</p>
<p>I highly recommend that when it comes to the important web services in your life, you find products you love and are worth paying for. If you take the free and easy option, you likely will be the product not the customer or you won’t have much to complain about when that service gets shut down.</p>

        <p>In case you missed it, Ohio State won the inaugural College Football Playoff last night. In my imaginary world, they were up for one title, and the won it; defeating B1G rival Michigan State 31-28 in the 12 team playoff.</p>
<p>In the 16 team playoff, Michigan State was runner up again losing 35-30 to Ole Miss. Lots of fun and upsets were had along the way. Let’s hope the appetizer that was this 4 team playoff gets expanded to be something more exciting (while still maintaining the importance of the regular season by letting in all conference champs).</p>
