					<h2 class="post__date">June 30th, 2015</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>One of my favorite websites right now is <a href="http://mymorningroutine.com">My Morning Routine</a>, where they ask people questions about, shockingly, their morning routine. I&#39;ve always <em>loved</em> mornings. They are my favorite part of the day. I&#39;ve recently gotten into a much better routine, so I thought I&#39;d share it here using the questions from MMR.</p>
				<h2 id="what-is-your-morning-routine-">What is your morning routine?</h2>
				<p>I pop up every morning between 6:30 and 7 AM. I&#39;ve been progressively trying to get up a little bit earlier. I leave my phone (and alarm) a few steps away from my bed so I have to actually get up to turn it off. If I didn&#39;t do that I would stay in bed for hours.</p>
				<p>I slink out of the bedroom and open up the door to my office to let the cats out. They sleep in there because they are two crazy little monsters who will wreak noisy havoc all night.</p>
				<p>My first task of the morning is to get some coffee. To be clear, I&#39;m not one of those people who is like <em>OMG I MUST HAVE COFFEE OR I CANNOT FUNCTION</em>. I function fine without it, but I love drinking a cup in the morning. It&#39;s much more about the joy of making and drinking it than the caffeine. Since it&#39;s summer, we try to keep a pitcher of cold brew in the fridge at all times for iced coffee. Otherwise I&#39;ll fire up the kettle for one of the many hot water coffee devices we have. While I&#39;ll drink just about any coffee, it&#39;s always better from Blue Bottle.</p>
				<p>Once I&#39;ve got my coffee I do some reading. Email, RSS feeds, Instapaper, magazines, or books. Could be any or all of these. I&#39;m currently reading Marcus Aurelius&#39; <em>Meditations</em> and a book on teaching kids to be better eaters.</p>
				<p>After that my schedule varies by day of the week. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, I do some work on my iOS game, <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a>. On Tuesday and Thursday, I try to write something to get it up on my blog. I&#39;d really prefer to write every day, but if I want to get Outshape released soon I have to put the time in.</p>
				<p>After a little over an hour of writing or working, it&#39;s time to get out and run. I&#39;m trying to get myself back into decent shape, so I&#39;m running a mile every day. I&#39;m just trying to get that mile time somewhere I&#39;m satisfied with before I start upping my distance. </p>
				<p>After my run I take a quick cool shower, find some breakfast, and feed the cats. At this point my morning is pretty much done and it&#39;s time to get up into my office to work.</p>
				<h2 id="how-long-have-you-stuck-with-this-routine-so-far-">How long have you stuck with this routine so far?</h2>
				<p>In it&#39;s current iteration, I&#39;ve been using this routine for about a month. Most of the elements existed beforehand, but they were compressed into a shorter time. I would just wake up when I felt like it. But that was before I started work at MetaLab. Now I don&#39;t have all day to do the work that&#39;s just for me.</p>
				<h2 id="what-time-do-you-go-to-sleep-">What time do you go to sleep?</h2>
				<p>Usually somewhere between 10:30 and 11:30, depending on when Lauren and I eat dinner and what has captivated us on Netflix.</p>
				<h2 id="do-you-do-anything-before-going-to-bed-to-make-your-morning-easier-">Do you do anything before going to bed to make your morning easier?</h2>
				<p>The aforementioned leaving the phone across the room is a big thing for me. I will shut that alarm off and go back to sleep if I&#39;m not forced to physically get out of bed.</p>
				<p>Early on in my routine I would put a little more work into explicitly planning my next morning and day. I&#39;ve gotten into the groove now and don&#39;t do this quite so strictly.</p>
				<p>I also <em>like</em> to clean up the kitchen a bit in the evenings when possible. My morning is a lot more pleasant when there isn&#39;t a mess I&#39;m confronted with. But sometimes we eat late and we&#39;re just too tired to deal with it in the evening.</p>
				<h2 id="do-you-use-an-alarm-to-wake-you-up-in-the-morning-and-if-so-do-you-ever-hit-the-snooze-button-">Do you use an alarm to wake you up in the morning, and if so do you ever hit the snooze button?</h2>
				<p>Yep I use the standard alarm on my phone. Since I have to get out of bed, it&#39;s <strong>very</strong> rare that I hit the snooze button. I won&#39;t say it never happens, but I love mornings too much once I&#39;m up.</p>
				<h2 id="how-soon-after-waking-up-do-you-have-breakfast-and-what-do-you-typically-have-">How soon after waking up do you have breakfast, and what do you typically have?</h2>
				<p>Generally it&#39;s a couple of hours. A fun fact about me is I don&#39;t have a functioning thyroid gland. So every morning I have to take synthroid. A side effect of that is I&#39;m not particularly hungry until I&#39;ve taken it, and I&#39;m not hungry until at least an hour after I&#39;ve taken it.</p>
				<p>What I eat for breakfast is one aspect of my morning I&#39;m not particularly thrilled with. It&#39;s usually either cereal or oatmeal (old fashioned oats, none of that instant crap). Occasionally I&#39;ll have greek yogurt with granola and honey. I&#39;d really like to get more protein but I&#39;m not a huge fan of eggs nor do I like taking a ton of time to make breakfast. I&#39;m thinking about trying out Soylent for my breakfasts.</p>
				<h2 id="do-you-have-a-morning-workout-routine-">Do you have a morning workout routine?</h2>
				<p>Just my morning run! I&#39;d like to find a gym with a good basketball court, but they&#39;re surprisingly hard to find. I want a nice court to go shoot in the morning, but most gyms just don&#39;t have the space.</p>
				<h2 id="do-you-have-a-morning-meditation-routine-and-if-so-what-kind-of-meditation-do-you-practise-">Do you have a morning meditation routine, and if so what kind of meditation do you practise?</h2>
				<p>This is the other big aspect of my morning I&#39;d like to improve. I&#39;d like to spend more time reading the bible and in prayer in the morning. Too often it&#39;s the thing that gets pushed aside for all of the other &quot;more productive&quot; stuff.</p>
				<h2 id="do-you-answer-email-first-thing-in-the-morning-or-leave-it-until-later-in-the-day-">Do you answer email first thing in the morning, or leave it until later in the day?</h2>
				<p>I get very little email that needs answering. But I try to wait as long as possible before looking at it. I don&#39;t get anything urgent and it can be dealt with later in the day when I have less energy.</p>
				<h2 id="do-you-use-any-apps-or-products-to-enhance-your-sleep-or-morning-routine-">Do you use any apps or products to enhance your sleep or morning routine?</h2>
				<p>Nothing major. I would say f.lux is the biggest help.
				I keep my habits in Omnifocus to make sure I&#39;m knocking them out and reviewing them occasionally.</p>
				<h2 id="what-and-when-is-your-first-drink-in-the-morning-">What and when is your first drink in the morning?</h2>
				<p>Almost always a coffee. Could be iced, or from the aeropress, french press, or chemex. We have an espresso machine, but it&#39;s been struggling lately. One of my hopes for the next year is to upgrade it, because I love a cappuccino or latte in the morning.</p>
				<h2 id="do-you-also-follow-this-routine-on-weekends-or-do-you-change-some-steps-">Do you also follow this routine on weekends, or do you change some steps?</h2>
				<p>I follow it, but a little more loosely. I tend to sleep a <em>little</em> longer and I don&#39;t run every day on the weekend. As far as reading, writing, and development goes, I tend to just let my mood lead me. I&#39;ll work on (or not work on) whatever I feel like in the moment.</p>
				<h2 id="on-days-you-re-not-settled-in-your-home-are-you-able-to-adapt-your-routine-to-fit-in-with-a-different-environment-">On days you’re not settled in your home, are you able to adapt your routine to fit in with a different environment?</h2>
				<p>It sort of depends on the environment. Some changes are more friendly to the routine than others. I at least try to get myself up early and do some reading and writing when I can. I really struggle to get exercise when I&#39;m in a different environment.</p>
				<h2 id="what-do-you-do-if-you-fail-to-follow-your-morning-routine-and-how-does-this-influence-the-rest-of-your-day-">What do you do if you fail to follow your morning routine, and how does this influence the rest of your day?</h2>
				<p>It&#39;s a little stressful. I feel a bit like I&#39;m not as productive. But I try to just find some time in the day to do the important things; running, reading, and writing.</p>

				<p>Finally, the baby came out and made his first cry. And they brought me over to him, and he was covered in blood and amniotic fluid and had vernix in the creases of his skin, but he looked fucking GREAT. His weight was good. His brain was good. His everything was good. All the selfish, terrible thoughts were sandblasted away. No regrets. Then I looked back to my wife, and she was still alive, beautiful as ever. And I burst into tears. I was wearing a surgical mask during the delivery but it got so gummed up with tears and snot that I was basically wearing a used Kleenex. And I called my mom and my wife&#39;s mom and I said, &quot;THEY&#39;RE ALIVE!&quot; because that was all that mattered. He was alive. She was alive. You can deal with anything in this life, so long as you&#39;re not dead.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p><em>Fantastic</em> recounting of the birth of his son, who came seven weeks early. It&#39;s terrifying to think about Lauren having to give birth in just a few weeks, but that&#39;s exactly what this was like. So glad he was okay.</p>

						<p>Fantastic piece from J.D. Bentley on exactly what being a conservative means to him. I particularly love this quote from Yuval Levin:</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Conservatives tend to see the human person as an incorrigible mass of contradictions: a fallen and imperfect being created in a divine image, a creature possessed of fundamental dignity and inalienable rights but prone to excess and to sin and ever in need of self-restraint and moral formation.</p>

						<blockquote>
				<p>For a generation, many North American parents have indulged children’s picky eating tendencies by sticking them in an endlessly repeating loop of chicken fingers, burgers, pizza, plain pasta, mac and cheese, and grilled cheese sandwiches. Anyone who has sat down for a meal with youngsters over the past 25 years will recognize this list of typical “kids’ foods.” Pushed out of the picture, to varying degrees for different children, are fruits and vegetables and anything else that might challenge them, from spicy delicacies to unfamiliar proteins. To picture what this might look like to a visitor from almost anywhere else in the world, imagine we just mashed up some bread and cheese and mechanically separated chicken flesh together, called it Kiddy Chow, and bought it by the bag to rip open to feed the tots.</p>
				<p>Mealtimes for children were quite different just a few decades ago. Over the past few months, I’ve spoken casually and in formal interviews with dozens of people about food and childhood. As a general rule, people who grew up in North America and are now over the age of 30 recall that when they were children, kids ate what the adults ate. Families usually dined together at the table. There might have been foods you didn’t like; depending on the rules of the house you might have been expected to try them or even finish them. Or you might have been free not to, as long as there weren’t too many foods you were refusing. Either way, it wouldn’t have occurred to you that an adult was going jump up from the table to prepare you something precisely to your liking. And if you didn’t eat, you might have to wait quite a while for the next opportunity: Studies show that North American kids snack more often and consume more calories than they did in the 1970s.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>With a baby on the way, this is something that has been on my mind more and more. I want to be intentional about what my child eats, and make sure she doesn’t grow up like her dad. </p>
				<p>I grew up eating a metric ton (wait, no, not metric) of bagel bites, lean cuisines, mac and cheese, and grilled cheeses. I <em>always</em> wanted the kids menu at restaurants and as embarrassing as it is, I still frequently do. If my wife isn’t around to make dinner or at least plan it, I will stuff my face with <strong>[BRAND NAME]</strong> mac and cheese. I absolutely believe that teaching good and varied eating habits to kids will turn them into healthier eaters as they grow up.</p>
				<p><em>Aside: Mom. I love you. You did a great job raising me. You had to raise four of us at a time and it was a freaking war zone. I chewed on piano keys and carved angry messages into desks. I threw some monster tantrums. I really don’t know how you made it out alive.</em></p>
				<p>Some of the strategies outlined here are going to be a good guide for how we want to raise our children to eat. I don’t want my child sucked into seductive kids menus. I’m not going to give her whatever she wants to eat all the time. I want her to try new and strange foods and grow up with that sort of culinary curiosity.</p>
				<p>Of course there’s no doubt kids tend to emulate their parents. So if I want my kids to be more adventurous in their diets I’m going to have to do the same. I’m trying to do that right now. I’m saying yes to things with more tomatoes and onions than I’m used to. Often times, it turns out that I like what I’m eating just fine. I’d just refused to accept it because it had something that I didn’t like all that much as a kid. Plus, it wasn’t beige. I thrive on the beige to yellow-ish portion of the menu. But fatherhood changes you, and I think this is just one of many ways I’m going to change.</p>

				<p>I love this. Too often when I say <em>anything</em> on the internet, I feel like if it’s at all technical I have to be an expert who is never wrong. I want to be more okay with sharing what I’m thinking and learning and not being afraid to be wrong.</p>

						<p>The minimum wage is one of those things that sounds great in theory and always gets people excited, but has a lot of problems. J.D.

					<h1 class="post__title"><a href="/soylent/">Soylent</a></h1>
					<h2 class="post__date">June 15th, 2015</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>Soylent is being talked about more and more, particularly in the tech world. The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/technology/in-busy-silicon-valley-protein-powder-is-in-demand.html?_r=0">wrote</a> about engineers who are ditching lunch so they can get more work in…</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Boom times in Silicon Valley call for hard work, and hard work — at least in technology land — means that coders, engineers and venture capitalists are turning to liquid meals with names like Schmoylent, Soylent, Schmilk and People Chow. The protein-packed products that come in powder form are inexpensive and quick and easy to make — just shake with water, or in the case of Schmilk, milk. While athletes and dieters have been drinking their dinner for years, Silicon Valley’s workers are now increasingly chugging their meals, too, so they can more quickly get back to their computer work. </p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is just the kind of ridiculous attitude about something that comes from Silicon Valley. Hustle. Grind. Drink lunch at your desk so you can <em>keep on working</em>.  Give me a break.</p>
				<p>I find soylent incredibly interesting, but not so I can spend more time at my desk working. Something more like <a href="http://www.insignificant.info/blog-native/2015/5/21/soylent">this</a>:</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>The best meals to replace with Soylent are the meals you aren’t excited about. I’m talking about boring sandwiches, generic lunches near the office, hasty breakfasts, or even “I just need to eat something” dinners. Those aren’t fun eating experiences. They don’t bring delight to your life. They probably cost more than they should, waste time, and are often unhealthy. If you are on a diet, these are the meals where you are likely to cheat and then regret it.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I often don’t eat breakfast or I eat crap for lunch because I don’t have the time, energy, or materials to make something proper and decent for me. I see Soylent as a good solution to that. It’s an easily made and balanced meal to replace all that junk. </p>
				<p>I also like that I don’t have to worry about the conditions soylent ingredients were raised in. Unlike the bacon and eggs I had for breakfast or the burger I’m having for lunch, the ingredients to soylent don’t require massive slaughterhouses. </p>
				<p>I don’t want to stop eating food I enjoy. I can still go out to dinner with family and friends. Or I can have the occasional bacon and eggs in the morning. I just want to replace some of the crap I waste time on with something healthier and easy to make. I think Soylent provides that.</p>

						<p>At the beginning of this year I worked on my own <a href="http://chrisbrakebill.com/personal-manifesto/">personal manifesto</a>, a sort guide for how I live my life and what I prioritize. Now that we’re halfway through the year, I wanted to take a look back at it and see what I’m doing well and where I could do better.</p>
				<h2 id="relationships-with-family">Relationships with family</h2>
				<p>With the <a href="https://instagram.com/p/2wgvYYpLx4/">Charleston</a> on the way, my relationship with Lauren is better than ever, and we’re working hard to prepare for the challenge ahead.</p>
				<p>I could definitely do better with my family. I’m not good about picking up the phone and calling my siblings (or anyone for that matter). If I don’t have a specific reason to call, I usually don’t. I’d really like to change that. </p>
				<h2 id="responsible-use-of-goods-and-resources">Responsible use of goods and resources</h2>
				<p>I’ve definitely been able to make some strides here. Having a decent waste &amp; recycling company is a big reason why. I don’t even put the trash out every week because it frequently has one or no bags in it. That said, I would still like to find ways to waste less through composting and buying fewer unrecyclable products.</p>
				<p>I’ve recently adjusted how I take showers. I generally keep them on the luke warm to cool side. I never turn the handle more than halfway. Not only does it use less energy heating water, but I don’t feel the need to just stand in the shower so I take shorter, more efficient showers. I’ve also switched to using a homemade toothpaste so hopefully I’m creating a little less waste there.</p>
				<p>I’ve been working hard to reduce the amount of stuff in our home, but I’ve got a long way to go there. I’m slowly tossing or giving away things that I don’t need. But I’m still clinging to a large number of old Eagles jerseys…</p>
				<h2 id="care-of-my-body">Care of my body</h2>
				<p>This has largely been a failure this year. I’ve gotten very little exercise. I’ve not played much basketball or tennis like I wanted to. I’m trying to pay attention to what I eat, but I’ve mostly been passive. I tend to rely on Lauren to plan healthy meals, which she does very well. The good news is she usually does the grocery trips, so I’m not able to pick up a bunch of junk food. I don’t drink much soda anymore. I haven’t been to the doctor, which I desperately need to do.</p>
				<p>It’s not all bad news. Things are on the uptick with my fitness. I got back to scheduling my days (which is absolutely crucial to my productivity, more on that soon). And I’ve run every single day this week. I’m keeping my goals simple, but consistent. I want to run one mile every single day for a month. It’s quick and (mostly) easy, but it’s building a habit that should help me stay consistent. One of the things I’m looking at doing is using <a href="https://diy.soylent.com">Soylent</a> to replace some of the times in the week where I would eat crappy meals, or no meal at all.</p>
				<h2 id="serve-participate-in-community">Serve &amp; Participate in Community</h2>
				<p>Almost nothing but failure. There are only a couple of small positives I can think of. I went to a local monthly Cocoa Heads meetup, but unfortunately I’ve missed the two since that one. I’ve also started following the RSS feed for the <a href="http://knoxvillecitytn.iqm2.com/Citizens/Default.aspx">Knoxville City Council minutes</a>. It’s small, but it helps me keep a little bit up to date on what’s going on in the city. </p>
				<p>The good news is Lauren and I have found a church we really enjoy, but we need to get plugged into the community there. We have plenty of friends in Knoxville, many that we <em>love</em>, but we don’t really feel like we have a community. That’s something we want to work on.</p>

				<p>I’m not even sure what to say on this one. I don’t think I sussed it out well enough to properly evaluate myself. My rule of no electronics after 10 PM has not been a success. I’ve barely even thought about it. I’m going to work on making that an actual part of my day. I have a feeling it will be a little easier once Charleston comes.</p>
				<h2 id="relationship-with-god">Relationship with God</h2>
				<p>I think I’ve done a pretty crummy job here. I haven’t done anything to serve God in the community. I haven’t been regularly praying (other than at meals) or reading the bible. I haven’t talked about God with other communities outside of church.</p>
				<p>I think now that I’m back to intentionally scheduling my day, I’ll get in the habit of scheduling some time for God. Some prayer and bible reading time every day would be good. I also have been thinking about getting back to having a physical bible. If anyone has any recommendations they would be appreciated.</p>

				<p>So that’s where I am. If I can find some time soon, I might try to refine my manifesto and put the full version on the internet. What’s the point of having a guiding document if you can’t be held accountable? As I mentioned earlier, I’m doing more intentional planning of my daily work. I’d like to write about exactly what that looks like.</p>
