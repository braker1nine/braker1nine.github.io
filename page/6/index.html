						<blockquote>
				<p>Voluntary simplicity, or simple living, is a way of life that rejects the high-consumption, materialistic lifestyles of consumer cultures and affirms what is often just called ‘the simple life’ or ‘downshifting.’ The rejection of consumerism arises from the recognition that ordinary Western-style consumption habits are degrading the planet; that lives of high consumption are unethical in a world of great human need; and that the meaning of life does not and cannot consist in the consumption or accumulation of material things. Extravagance and acquisitiveness are accordingly considered an unfortunate waste of life, certainly not deserving of the social status and admiration they seem to attract today. The affirmation of simplicity arises from the recognition that very little is needed to live well – that abundance is a state of mind, not a quantity of consumer products or attainable through them.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is a concept that has been on my mind a lot lately. As we plan our move and I see the amount of crap we accumulate, I can’t help but think we need a better strategy when it comes to the goods we acquire. When I was trying to write out a <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/02/13/how-and-why-to-write-your-own-personal-manifesto/">personal manifesto</a> in my journal, one of the things I landed on that was important to me was my use of goods and resources. Here are the bullet points:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Actively looking for ways to reduce my waste</li>
				<li>Only keep things that are frequently useful, or which I like to look at</li>
				<li>Think more carefully when acquiring new things about sustainability, utility, and aesthetic value</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This ‘simple living’ doesn’t mean buying cheap stuff. In fact, to me it means the opposite in many cases. I want to acquire <em>less</em> stuff, but I want it to be higher quality. I want to buy things that last and that I enjoy seeing in my home.</p>

						<p>Just over three years ago, I was doing a little freelancing and working on an idea for a fantasy football site I had. I’d spent the year applying to jobs, occasionally landing interviews, and always getting turned down. I saw the “We’re Hiring” link on my ESPN Fantasy Football clubhouse, and figured why not?</p>
				<p>A month later I was sitting next to Jerry Rice on a bus to get my rental car for my interview. Within a week, I was hired at ESPN as a web developer in the League Manager group. I moved across the country to Seattle and immediately got to work helping to build Fantasy Football for iPad.</p>
				<p>ESPN was the first company to actually give me the chance to show what I’m capable of. And I like to think they don’t regret it. I’ve been able to contribute to some incredible projects in my time here, and in the process I’ve learned a <strong>shit ton</strong> about what it takes to develop a large scale web application.</p>
				<p>Now the time has come for me to leave ESPN. My wife and I have been looking for a while at moving home to Knoxville, Tennessee and we’re finally able to make that happen. While we’re incredibly excited about it, we’re a bit melancholy about having to leave the company that has given me so much.</p>
				<p>I’m so thankful for the opportunity to get to work here. I’m thankful for the incredible and talented group of people I got to work with. I got to experience the other side of the interview table, and I got to experience not being excited about a candidate, only to realize once they were hired how fucking wrong I was (This is why I’m incredibly sympathetic to the many “no’s” I’ve received).</p>
				<p>When my then fiancée started grad school in Orlando, my manager and superiors were awesome and worked hard to make it possible for me to move and work from Florida while staying in my current role. When I told them I wanted to move to Knoxville, they did everything they could to make it happen but it just wasn’t in the cards. I’m so thankful for all of those efforts and the appreciation they showed.</p>
				<p>ESPN and Disney are fantastic organizations that appreciate their employees and reward them for good work. I will certainly miss the magic that both provide. More than that I will miss the many people I’ve worked with that make that magic possible. I have no doubt that my team will continue to do awesome work without me. I like to think part of me will stick around there (and not just a few poorly named variables and accidentally committed debugger statements). I’m positive that a part of ESPN and Disney will always be with me. </p>
				<p>My only regret is that my coworkers will no longer have someone around to constantly remind them that the SEC is superior to all other forms of sport.</p>
				<p>I don’t yet know what my next thing will be. I’m pondering a few options. I will keep sending my <a href="http://chrisbrakebill.com/threethings">newsletter</a>. I hope to launch <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape/">Outshape</a> in the coming months. And I&#39;m really dying to get into a little podcasting. If you want to work together on something, let me know!</p>

						<p>M.G. Siegler with a great piece on the future of cinema, and the movie going experience in general. What really resonated with me, and is something that has been on my mind for a while, is the experience of going to movie theaters.</p>
				<p>There’s something very romantic to me about the movie theater. I’m not sure where it comes from, since it’s never been anything like that in my life. I love the idea of the night out at the movie theater. But the fact is that night out revolves around two hours in the dark without talking. The theaters have essentially worked their butts off over the past few decades to figure out how to get you to buy really expensive shit to go along with that experience.</p>
				<p>What Siegler hits on that I really want more of is the sort of boutique movie theater...</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Probably the best experience I’ve had watching a film in recent years is over here in London. There’s a theater called Electric Cinema in Notting Hill which is fantastic in every way. Massive recliner seats, couches, and even beds and blankets! And lots of good food and drinks.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>There are a couple of similar theaters in North Orlando, and I love the experience. Compare it with the dirty, uncomfortably 80s experience of movie theaters today, and you see why I think this is the real future of movie theaters. It’s a dream of mine to open up a sort of boutique theater with a nice bar and an interesting menu...</p>

					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>I’ve been quite effusive about <a href="http://www.simple.com">Simple</a> since I first signed up. There are two particular features of Simple that make it <em>incredibly</em> powerful as a financial planning tool: Goals and Safe-to-Spend.</p>
				<p>Simple allows you to create goals for any expense you’re planning. It works like this. You name your goal, set an amount you’d like to save and then decide whether you want to save it now or save it over time until a specific date. This is where Safe-to-Spend comes in, because any money that is put into that goal is no longer available in your Safe-to-Spend total. If you choose to save over time, Simple will gradually move money from Safe-to-Spend and into the goal.</p>
				<p><img src="/images/simple/createGoalOverTime.png" alt="Creating a goal"></p>
				<p>The psychological power of this setup can’t be overstated. I know that I can see my actual balance and I may have plenty of money in my account, but if that Safe-to-Spend total is low then it’s hard to spend anymore. Not only would I feel like I’m spending money I don’t have, but I could see in my goals the things that I’m taking money away from if I spend beyond my Safe-to-Spend. Effectively it’s a digital version of Dave Ramsey’s <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/article/dave-ramseys-envelope-system/lifeandmoney_budgeting/">envelope system</a>. </p>
				<p>Also in the Goals section of the website, there’s this fantastic little popover that shows you how much money will be put in Goals until your next paycheck. In my opinion, this information is tremendously underemphasized.</p>
				<p><img src="/images/simple/paycheck.png" alt="Nice preview of your status until the next paycheck"></p>
				<p>So how do I use Simple? First off you have to get around one painful fact. Simple doesn’t have recurring goals. You can’t say a goal occurs once a month or year and have a goal automatically created. So let’s break down what different types of goals I have.</p>
				<h2 id="yearly-bills">Yearly Bills</h2>
				<p>Evernote, Dropbox, Fastmail, and the list goes on. If I can get a cheaper bill by going yearly, I usually do it. Once a year I create a goal for these items. Easy to maintain. And you’re never surprised by a big unexpected expense. You’ve been saving all year, and that big expense is just a blip.</p>
				<h2 id="monthly-bills">Monthly Bills</h2>
				<p>I started out trying to maintain the monthly things by actually creating a goal each month. But that takes a lot of work and can get a little confusing within a given pay period. So it’s better to handle these yearly as well. Many monthly bills, like rent, cable, internet, or mobile phone, have the same cost every month. With these you can calculate a total for the year and create a goal. Then by the time each bill rolls around, you should have just the right amount to pay it from the goal.</p>
				<p>Others, like utilities, are variable. For the variable bills it helps if you have a year’s worth of bills to look through, then you can estimate what a year is going to cost and get pretty close. What’s important is that you have a decently close number, and your goal will prevent that monthly bill from making a dent in your Safe-to-Spend.</p>
				<h2 id="budgeting">Budgeting</h2>
				<p>Another type of goal I create is a yearly budget for certain categories. So I create a goal once a year for things like groceries, gas, tithing, and fun with my wife. Again, you’re looking for solid estimates here, not exact totals. If you have to make some adjustments throughout the year that’s okay. It forces you to really think about your spending on these things and be aware of it.</p>
				<h2 id="one-off-expenses">One off expenses</h2>
				<p>You can create goals for other expected or desired expenses. I have goals for my wife’s birthday, our anniversary, and Christmas. I can save all year for these things and not be caught off guard when they come around. If you are thinking you want to upgrade to a new phone next year, you can start saving now. This is how I make buying phones off contract a reasonable reality. Instead of a sudden major expense, or paying my carrier more every month to make that phone cheaper up front, I pay myself a little every day until iPhone launch day comes.</p>
				<h2 id="a-cushion">A cushion</h2>
				<p>When you start really using goals, you end up with a nice chunk of money in them that isn’t in your Safe-to-Spend. What’s nice is it gives you this cushion of immediately available money. If an unexpected expense does come in, you can pull some money out of a few goals and adjust your expectations. Maybe spend less at Christmas. Or cancel/reduce a service. Or just take the money out of the goal and know you’ll be able to compensate gradually. Instead of taking on credit card debt, you take on self debt. It’s so much nicer to know exactly what you’re sacrificing rather than blindly spending out of a single pool of money. <em>(Unless you have an actual pool of money, then you just do you)</em></p>
				<p>Simple has been a <em>huge</em> boon to my financial management. Bills and large expenses are easy to plan for and track and my stress levels are greatly reduced. I don’t have to plan and save in a spreadsheet, Simple does it for me. One might say it makes managing your finances... Simple?</p>
