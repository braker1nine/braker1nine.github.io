						<p>While most will be filling out their bracket the old fashioned way, closing your eyes and pointing a finger. But, I like to make my decisions based on mascots. Now this isn&#39;t your run of the mill <em>Which mascot would win in a fight</em> contest. I will, in a 100% subjective manner, decide which mascot is cooler. Let&#39;s not dally any longer...</p>
				<h2 id="first-round">First Round</h2>
				<h3 id="south">South</h3>
				<p><strong>(1) Florida Gators v. (16) Albany Great Danes</strong> - I give a lot of respect to straying from the typical dog breed. The only better breed Albany could have chosen was the Saint Bernard. <strong>Winner: Albany</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(8) Colorado Buffaloes v. (9) Pittsburgh Panthers</strong> - No one is winning <em>any</em> games with a mascot like &quot;Panthers&quot;. Unless they&#39;re playing another team with the same mascot and I like them better than that team. <strong>Winner: Colorado</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(5) VCU Rams v. (12) Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks</strong> - Come on. <strong>Winner: SF Austin</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(4) UCLA Bruins v. (13) Tulsa Golden Hurricane</strong> - UCLA gets credit for being Bears without actually calling themselves bears. Plus Bears are to be <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/210979/december-01-2008/exclusive---godless-killing-machines-mash-up">feared</a>. And there&#39;s nothing cool about hurricanes. <strong>Winner: UCLA</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(6) Ohio State Buckeyes v. (11) Dayton Flyers</strong> - When I hear the Flyers nickname, all I can think of is the Sandlot. And that&#39;s a win. <strong>Winner: Dayton</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(3) Syracuse Orange v. (14) Western Michigan Broncos</strong> - There&#39;s nothing cool about Broncos right now. <strong>Winner: Syracuse</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(7) New Mexico Lobos v. (10) Stanford Cardinal</strong> - I don&#39;t know what a Lobo is, but Cardinal? Singular? And the tree? <strong>Winner: New Mexico</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(2) Kansas Jayhawks v. (15) E. Kentucky Colonels</strong> - Military mascots are cool. Birds are not. <strong>Winner: EKU</strong></p>
				<h3 id="east">East</h3>
				<p><strong>(1) Virgina Cavaliers v. (16) Coastal Carolina Chanticleers</strong> - Yeah. This goes against previous logic, but I can&#39;t stop saying Chanticleer. <strong>Winner: Coastal Carolina</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(8) Memphis Tigers v. (9) George Washington Colonials</strong> - Tigers don&#39;t win. Plus, Memphis. <strong>Winner: George Washington</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(5) Cincinnati Bearcats v. (12) Harvard Crimson</strong> - I have a soft spot in my heart for things that are half bear and half cat. <strong>Winner: Cincinnati</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(4) Michigan State Spartans v. (13) Delaware Fightin&#39; Blue Hens</strong> - Maybe if they were regular hens. But Blue hens? No. <strong>Winner: Michigan State</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(6) North Carolina Tar Heels v. (11) Providence Friars</strong> - You just don&#39;t mess with God. <strong>Winner: Providence</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(3) Iowa State Cyclones v. (14) NC Central Eagles</strong> - Fly Eagles Fly. Also, once again, weather patterns aren&#39;t cutting it. <strong>Winner: NC Central</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(7) Connecticut Huskies v. (10) St. Joe&#39;s Hawks</strong> - Weak first round matchup. I wish I could pick neither. But I really do like actual huskies. <strong>Winner: Connecticut</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(2) Villanova Wildcats v. (15) Milwaukee Panthers</strong> - Another bad first round matchup. I&#39;m picking based on my desire for this bracket to not suck. <strong>Winner: Villanova</strong></p>
				<h3 id="west">West</h3>
				<p><strong>(1) Arizona Wildcats v. (16) Weber State Wildcats</strong> - One of two all wildcat match ups. What a bummer. <strong>Winner: Arizona</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(8) Gonzaga Bulldogs v. (9) Oklahoma State Cowboys</strong> - I hate the <a href="http://vimeo.com/82637574">Cowboys</a>. <strong>Winner: Gonzaga</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(5) Oklahoma Sooners v. (12) ND State Bison</strong> - There&#39;s just something cool about Bison. <strong>Winner: ND State</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(4) San Diego State Aztecs v. (13) New Mexico State Aggies</strong> - There are too many Aggies and not enough Aztecs in college sports. <strong>Winner: San Diego State</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(5) Baylor Bears v. (12) Nebraska Cornhuskers</strong> - See previous matchup with a bear related mascot. <strong>Winner: Baylor</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(3) Creighton Blue Jays v. (14) LA-Lafayette Ragin&#39; Cajuns</strong> - This one isn&#39;t even close. Cajuns, when they&#39;re a-ragin&#39; can&#39;t be beat. <strong>Winner: LA-Lafayette</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(7) Oregon Ducks v. (10) BYU Cougars</strong> - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uIfRUV_XV0">Puddles</a> <strong>Winner: Oregon</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(2) Wisconsin Badgers v. (15) American Eagles</strong> - I&#39;m tempted not to give American a pass. Their full name sounds a bit... douchey. But... Eagles. <strong>Winner: American</strong></p>
				<h3 id="midwest">Midwest</h3>
				<p><strong>(1) Wichita State Shockers v. (16) Cal Poly Mustangs</strong> - Their mascot is the SHOCKERS. <strong>Winner: Wichita State</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(8) Kentucky Wildcats v. (9) Kansas State Wildcats</strong> - Another crummy wildcat matchup. I&#39;ll never pick John Calipari. <strong>Winner: Kansas State</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(5) St. Louis Bilikens v. (12) NC State Wolfpack</strong> - I&#39;m concerned about the repercussions of picking against the Biliken. <strong>Winner: St. Louis</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(4) Louisville Cardinals v. (13) Manhattan Jaspers</strong> - I don&#39;t know what a Jasper is, but it has to beat a Cardinal. <strong>Winner: Manhattan</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(6) UMass Minutemen v. (11) Tennessee Volunteers</strong> - It&#39;s hard to pick against the Minutemen. But... Volunteers? They do it for free. I&#39;m COMPLETELY objective here. <strong>Winner: Tennessee</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(3) Duke Blue Devils v. (14) Mercer Bears</strong> - THERE ARE A LOT OF BEARS IN THIS TOURNAMENT. <strong>Winner: Mercer</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(7) Texas Longhorns v. (10) Arizona State Sun Devils</strong> - Not a fan of the longhorns, but I can&#39;t pick devils. <strong>Winner: Texas</strong></p>
				<p><strong>(2) Michigan Wolverines v. (15) Wofford Terriers</strong> - This is an example of picking an alternate dog, and going the wrong way. <strong>Winner: Michigan</strong></p>

						<blockquote>
				<p>Sports labor attorney Jeffrey Kessler has filed suit against the NCAA and five power conferences, alleging that capping player compensation at the cost of a scholarship is an antitrust violation. Unlike previous suits, this one does not seek damages. It wants to tear down the NCAA. &quot;We&#39;re looking to change the system,&quot; Kessler said. &quot;That&#39;s the main goal.&quot;</p>
				<p>Kessler is the biggest hitter yet in the war against amateurism. He&#39;s partially responsible for bringing free agency to the NFL, and has served as outside counsel for both MLB and NBA players in labor battles against their respective leagues. He&#39;s joined in this suit by Tim Nevius, once the NCAA&#39;s associate director of enforcement.</p>

						<p>This episode of Walking Dead might have been the best hour of television I&#39;ve watched this year, which is an accomplishment considering... True Detective. </p>
				<p><strong>WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD</strong></p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>It&#39;s brutal, and TWD neither flinches from it nor sensationalizes it. It is just a stark, gut-wrenching moment that offers no visceral entertainment, just a horrible feeling in the pit in your stomach that forces you to wonder how this awfulness could have been avoided, and whether it could be at all. </p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>It was <em>brutal</em>, but you felt like it had to be done, which is such an unsettling feeling. It&#39;s a feeling that The Walking Dead really assaults you with. You&#39;re constantly torn between the morality you know and the new morality of the world the characters inhabit. No one has had to shift their morality more than Carol, and it&#39;s been almost chilling to see how pragmatically she&#39;s gone about it.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>So let&#39;s take one moment to add Chad Coleman and Melissa McBride to The Walking Dead actors who are knocking it out of the goddamn park the second half of this season. Carol&#39;s tough exterior cracks and breaks down as Lizzie gets more and more fucked up; and the scene where Tyreese forgives Carol is, by itself, as good as any performance on the show.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This this this. Mika&#39;s death and the subsequent dispatching of Lizzie were brutal, but that scene between Carol and Tyreese was unbelievable. That&#39;s what almost brought me to tears. The grace Tyreese showed her was just... damn.</p>

				<p>(15) American over (2) Wisconsin</p>
				<p>This is an easy one. It wouldn&#39;t be appropriate to call this an &quot;upset,&quot; really, since a) the committee that assigned the seeding of this tournament abided by a set of criteria completely unlike mine, and b) it&#39;s rather easy, from the outset, to take a glance at a matchup and immediately determine which ranks higher alphabetically.</p>

						<p>I would have been so excited about this 4 years ago. Now it&#39;s just too little too late. I always preferred the OneNote editor to the Evernote version, but I&#39;m way too invested in Evernote to look back now. It&#39;s where I save everything I want to be able to search for later. I stopped wasting my time labeling emails and being tied to Gmail when I realized I could just save anything I wanted to keep to Evernote and have offline access to it whenever I needed.</p>

				<p>In 2010, the Federal Communications Commission announced the National Broadband Plan, which promised to provide 100 million American households with high-speed cable by 2020. Verizon has been expanding FiOS in major markets, and AT&amp;T has been expanding its U-verse service. And now, instead of spending that war chest digging up streets and laying fiber cable, the cable and telephone companies have invested in a massive and very successful lobbying push. They are persuading state legislatures and regulatory boards to quietly adopt new rules—rules written by the telecoms—to eliminate their legal obligations to provide broadband service nationwide and replace landlines with wireless. This abrupt change in plans will leave vast areas of the country with poor service, slow telecommunications and higher bills.</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>What happens in countries where there’s real competition? In the UK, where incumbent provider BT is required to allow competitors to use its wired broadband network, home internet service prices are as low as £2.50 a month, or just over $4. In South Korea, where wireless giants SK Telecom and LG Uplus are locked in a fierce technology battle, customers have access to the fastest mobile networks in the world — up to 300Mbps, compared to a theoretical max of 80Mbps on Verizon that’s actually more like 15 or 20mbps in the real world.</p>
				<p>And Americans pay more for these slower wireless speeds than anyone else in the world: in Germany, where customers can freely switch between carriers by swapping SIM cards, T-Mobile customers pay just $1.18 per Mbps of speed. In the US, our mostly incompatible wireless networks lock customers in with expensive handsets they can’t take elsewhere, allowing AT&amp;T and Verizon to charge around $4 per Mbps each and Sprint to clock in at an insane $7.50.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Those two paragraphs are so depressing to me.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>So there’s the entire problem, expressed in four simple ideas: the internet is a utility, there is zero meaningful competition to provide that utility to Americans, all internet providers should be treated equally, and the FCC is doing a miserably ineffective job. The United States should lead the world in broadband deployment and speeds: we should have the lowest prices, the best service, and the most competition. We should have the freest speech and the loudest voices, the best debate and the soundest policy. We are home to the most innovative technology companies in the world, and we should have the broadband networks to match.</p>
				<p>We should stop fucking it up.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>If you want to do something, email the FCC chair at tom.wheeler@fcc.com and call 1-888-225-5322. Calls to your <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">representatives</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">senators</a> are always good too.</p>
