				<p>Introverts are professional listeners. Their natural state is to observe and gather data from the world around them as opposed to their extroverts counterparts who enjoying spending their time talking about the state of the world and all the fascinating data in the world… endlessly.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>All to often, society says that introversion is bad and extroversion is the “proper” or “successful” way to be. This seems to be a more common thought when it comes to leadership. Rands points out that introverts have some pretty huge natural advantages when it comes to good leadership, just as extroverts do. Both most overcome their own weaknesses to make use of their strengths.</p>

						<p>In the process of job hunting for life after ESPN, I managed to land some early interviews with Pixar. While technically it would still be under the umbrella of the same company (Disney), Pixar is sort of <em>that</em> company for me. I love everything they do and want badly to be a part of creating beautifully told stories.</p>
				<p>But as we were going through that process my wife and I struggled with the fact that going to Pixar meant moving to California. We’ve been planning on moving to Knoxville for quite a while, and we just weren’t sure San Francisco is where we wanted to live. </p>
				<p>Then things changed. We found out we were going to have our first child. I still badly wanted the job with Pixar, but the decision was no longer a struggle. We want to raise children surrounded by family and friends. We weren’t going to move to San Francisco. It hurt badly and it was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do, but I had to tell them I wouldn’t be going any further in the interview process. </p>
				<p>I had friends say I should have kept going through the process, but that just felt wrong to me. Yes it’s good experience, but in my option it’s selfish to waste the time of hard working people when I know I’m not going to take a job offer. I think it would have shown a lack of respect for the people I was interviewing with.</p>
				<p>I’d be lying if I said I didn’t think about it every day and feel a little sad, but I think a lot more every day about that baby and how excited I am to raise him or her around my family and friends.</p>

						<blockquote>
				<p>The biggest difference between that day and a normal weekend day, I realize now, was that I paid little attention to the advance of time. I suspended all aspirations to shaping the future. The only goal was to enjoy the setting and characters of every moment I found myself in, which is refreshingly easy when you’re not trying to get anywhere else.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is so incredibly true for me. So often I’m busying my self with the advance of time. Always thinking about how I could be using the upcoming time productively. Or getting frustrated because the time has flown by and I haven’t used it “well”.</p>
				<p>Cain provides some great tips on how to take a proper day off. Working some of these into my life will help make me leisure time more enjoyable, and I’m betting will make me a little more fun to be around.</p>

					<h2 class="post__date">April 1st, 2015</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>Last year, when Lauren and I found out we were pregnant I was like 75% scared and 25% excited. We had no plans to have a baby yet. But there we were, expecting one. I’m not sure it’s something you’re ever <em>ready</em> for. But it’s best to at least be planning for it a little bit. (Apparently I married into a fertile family)</p>
				<p>When we lost the baby, it was so early in the pregnancy I had a hard time connecting with it. We we’re scared/excited for a couple of weeks. Then just scared shitless for one more. And then just immensely sad. But through all of that, it was hard to feel it was connected to a child. It was more like this roller coaster of expectation changing that Lauren and I went on. One of the most brutal parts about it, was how it affected us differently. How we could be so far apart on the sad to happy spectrum on an hourly basis. </p>
				<p>This year we were more ready. Not like <em>planning</em> ready. But it was at least something we had talked about. I think we’d hoped to get settled into Knoxville before Munchkin (that’s what I’m calling him/her) came along, but it wasn’t devastating to have to adjust to new expectations.</p>
				<p>Now here we are, less than six months from bringing a human life into the world. Our future nursery is currently the cats’ bedroom, which basically means a room full of unpacked boxes. I’m unemployed and Lauren is just getting started acquiring clients (If you’re in Knoxville and looking for a counselor or someone to talk to, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend <a href="http://www.ebenezercounseling.com/Brakebill.html">her</a>). And we don’t even have a dog yet. I thought for sure we’d have to get a dog before we could have a baby.</p>
				<p>Yet, despite all those concerns, I can’t help but feel like we’re way more ready for this than we were a year ago. I’m confident that God will provide the right opportunities for us to support this child. I’m trying hard to not be closed off to the job opportunities my family brings me. And speaking of my family, the idea of raising a child is made a million times easier knowing the support we have here in Knoxville.</p>
				<p>I guess what I’m saying is my excited to scared ratio is much more balanced this time. So that’s good right?</p>

				<p>What do you do if you’re Tennessee athletic director Dave Hart and a coach who has won 70 percent of his career games, has made more NCAA Tournament appearances (22) than the Vols have made in their history (20) and has won everywhere he’s been (George Mason, Providence, Clemson, Texas) drops into your lap?</p>

				<p>We all love Bruce Pearl, but it’s pretty clear that Rick Barnes has had a much better career. How can you argue with a coach who has more NCAA Tournament appearances than your entire program?</p>

				<p>I believe there is a straight line between how the studio feels, how we as designers treat each other, and the innovative impact of the team.</p>

				<p>Some really great nuggets in here for creating an effective creative workplace. No dickheads is obvious. But many of their guidelines are under appreciated in today’s workplace. Eating and cooking together, reading fiction, sharing your family with your coworkers and your coworkers with your family. These things can turn where you work into more than just that place you go to earn your living. They cultivate a place where you experience joy and growth. Where your work feeds your soul and your soul feeds your work. And that’s how you get shit done.</p>

				<p>We are our first users — we’re using the workflows and environment that we set up for ourselves to make good decisions on behalf of ourselves, our families, our clients, and our users. We know the consequences of decision fatigue and poor choices better than most. We’re never going to eliminate decision fatigue from our own lives, or from anyone else’s, but by changing our own habits and lessening our own decision fatigue, we can make better choices more consistently throughout the day, which leads to a better experience for everyone.</p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about decision fatigue lately and how it might affect me. I’m trying to get to the more important things as early in the day as possible.</p>

				<p>This seems to be becoming a depressingly common story. Guy or girl creates something cool or popular. Gets an uncomfortable amount of hate over how they manage it. Checks out. Lucky for Persson it netted him well north of a billion dollars. But no amount of money makes that kind of hate feel any better.</p>
