						<p>Developers like control. We like things to be just how we like. It tends to take some time to get things that way. This becomes a bit of a problem when you need to do a clean OS install or move to a new machine. How do you restore shell settings? Install node packages? Install your favorite apps?</p>
				<p>There are a lot of solutions out there for automating system setups like <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://boxen.github.com">Boxen</a> but those seem a little heavy for a personal setup (though I’m open to suggestions otherwise).</p>
				<p>In 2012, I had the chance to take a sort of git crash course from Github’s <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewmccull">Matthew McCullough</a> and encountered his system setup <a href="https://github.com/matthewmccullough/dotfiles">process</a>. I’ve been using the zsh aliases and oh-my-zsh for a long while with some minor tweaks, but after a recent clean install I decided to really make it work.</p>
				<p><a href="http://brew.sh">Brew</a> is a fantastic tool for installing packages that you want. But the real game changer for me was <a href="http://caskroom.io">Cask</a>. It installs Mac applications automatically right from the script. You’re limited to apps that have been added by the community and you can’t install the apps you’ve bought on the Mac App Store, but it’s a great start.</p>
				<p>Now when I load up a fresh OS X install all I have to do is install Dropbox and let it sync, go into my dotfiles folder and run </p>
				<pre>_setupdotfiles.zsh</pre>
				
				<p>And I’m set. I’m sure I’ll find improvements along the way. But I thought I’d share <a href="https://github.com/braker1nine/dotfiles">my setup</a> so it might benefit someone else.</p>

						<p>A while back, Dan Benjamin and Merlin Mann discussed how blue light affects our sleep on <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/160">Back to Work</a>. It was a really fantastic discussion and it resonated with my own experiences. I tended to sit up late at night, staring at my phone and wondering why I wasn’t sleepy.</p>
				<p>They link <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-light-affects-our-sleep/#axzz2uMAnScJH">here</a> where Mark Sisson dives into the science of why blue light keeps us awake:</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Blue light regulates our secretion of melatonin, the sleep hormone. Exposed to blue light, we limit the production of melatonin, and we stay alert and awake; in the absence of blue light, melatonin production ramps up, and we get sleepy. This system worked quite well for a long time. Reddish light from fire (our formerly primary source of nighttime illumination) has little to no effect on melatonin production, so sleep wasn’t disrupted when we relied on fire. These days, though, we’re subject to a steady barrage of blue light. During the day, blue light (natural or unnatural) isn’t much of a problem because we’re supposed to be awake, but at night, when we’re “supposed” to be getting ready to sleep, we tend to sit in front of blue light-emanating appliances, and our sleep suffers for it.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I’m generally a skeptical guy, but this felt anecdotally right to me. I already had <a href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a> installed on my MacBook and felt at night as if <em>it was making me</em> tired.</p>
				<p>In addition, I moved my phone charger to the office and left it there at night. Not having it next to me has taken away the temptation to look at it. That is a temptation I cannot resist. <strong>IT’S SO CLOSE. I CAN REACH IT INDY.</strong> Since my Fitbit broke, I’ve moved my phone back into the bedroom for alarm purposes, but I keep it across the room. It’s actually fantastic because it keeps me from staring at the phone at night and forces me to get up in the morning to shut it off. The only time I keep my phone on the nightstand anymore is when I’m on call.</p>
				<p>I was frequently laying in bed, unable to fall asleep, and then finally getting up to go downstairs and read myself into a coma (Kindle FTW), but I haven’t done that in months it seems. I still have some nights where I struggle to sleep, but that’s usually due to shoulder pain and having another human taking up space in the bed. I like to really spread my elbows out, and they can do damage. <strong>(MARRIAGE TIP: Use separate blankets. Thank me later).</strong></p>

				<p>It’s a strong word. I don’t mean that you intend pain, injury, or damage. But I’m an introvert and you – as a new unknown human – are a threat to me. I don’t know what you want and you most definitely want something and until I figure that out, you’re a threat.</p>

				<p>The greatest evil is this: pride, avarice, lust, envy, gluttony, anger, and sloth. Avoid those and you’ll arrive at their polar opposites, which are the greatest good: humility, charity, chastity, kindness, temperance, patience, and diligence.</p>
				<p>If you lack purpose, if your life is a mess, then you are surely practicing, in some measure, the evils and failing to practice the good. There’s no easy fix for that. There’s no expert for that. There are no “12-steps” or “30-days” that can turn that around for you. It’s a choice made daily and fought for by the minute. It’s exhausting.</p>
				<p>But it’s the only thing that works. Anything else is snake oil.</p>
