				<p>Seriously, Apple launched the App Store with no mechanism for Trials and Upgrades and we all just though “Meh, that’s fine.” Turns out, we screwed over everything by accepting that.</p>

				<p>I wrote a bunch of crap about this, but didn&#39;t feel like I had a coherent thought. Thankfully Ben Brooks took care of it for me. I&#39;m not convinced the top lists are a positive or a negative. But these other failures are a huge negative.</p>

						<p>David Smith talked on his podcast today about <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes!/id779157948?mt=8">Threes!</a> and 2048. In particular he was talking about an acquaintance playing 2048, and how he perceived this acquaintance&#39;s experience. You&#39;ll have to <a href="http://developingperspective.com/2014/07/24/0/">listen</a> to hear the nuances of his point, but essentially his deduction was that 2048 made the acquaintance feel smart and that&#39;s why he valued it versus Threes!.</p>
				<p>This really missed the mark for me. I think by design Threes! gives users the exact same feeling. It&#39;s more difficult for sure, but it provides the exact same satisfaction. What you take pride in achieving is really based on what your friends achieve. If he feels smart, it&#39;s because he&#39;s doing better than his average friend. While he might take pride in beating 2048, he would take the same pride in getting the 768 block in Threes! if his friends were struggling to. </p>
				<p>This user wasn&#39;t playing 2048 because it made him feel smart and Threes! couldn&#39;t. He was playing because 2048 was free. Free games are easier to pick up. You can try them without risking your money. They copied the simple mechanics that made Threes! enjoyable to play and put them out for free. What this story tells me is that this guy, like a lot of App Store consumers, values his $5 (or whatever Threes! costs nowadays).</p>
				<p>David&#39;s larger point was to understand what it is your potential customers value, which I think was good. We know that a lot of customers (nay, users; if they don&#39;t pay they aren&#39;t customers) will deal with a lot of crap from a product if it&#39;s gives them some utility they don&#39;t have to pay for. </p>
				<p>Certainly developers should be thinking about how they can generate value for customers. 2048 has done that by providing a ton of eyeballs to the customers who pay for ads. The best products, <em>in my opinion</em>, are the ones that can generate enough value to convince users pay for them. Products like David&#39;s own Feed Wrangler/Pod Wrangler and especially apps with delightful and fun experiences like Threes!. </p>

				<p>Shawn Blanc likes to say that those who work with their minds, rest with their hands. It&#39;s something I absolutely believe in. Even throughout the day on a micro level, I take brief work rests to clean the kitchen, vacuum the living room, or sift through the horror that is the litter box.</p>
				<p>Shawn likes to do woodworking when he is resting. It&#39;s a hobby I would love to get into one day, but right now I don&#39;t have the money, space, or tools to do it.</p>
				<p>I have discovered a different but applicable hobby in barbecue. Not only do I enjoy the labor I put into it, but the fruits (well, meats) I get out of it are quite delicious. In the past month, I&#39;ve spent two of my Saturdays seasoning meat, soaking wood chips, and keeping my smoker at a consistent low heat.</p>
				<p><img src="/images/barbecue/raw_pork.jpg" alt="Pork Butt"></p>
				<p>One of the beauties of barbecue is it gives you a lot of time to relax. You have to pay attention to your smoker and the temperature, but it&#39;s a <em>long</em> process and there&#39;s a lot of waiting time. You can read a book, drink a beer, finally beat that level on TwoDots, write a letter to your representative, relax in the sun, etc etc etc.</p>
				<p><img src="/images/barbecue/outside_thermometer.jpg" alt="Drinking Coffee and waiting..."></p>
				<p>Another great thing about barbecue is there&#39;s a lot of freedom and creativity. You can spice it up however you want. Want to make it sweet? You can do that. Want to put sriracha on it? You can do that. Want to soak your ribs in Dr. Pepper? You can do that. There are so many ways to achieve different flavors. It&#39;s almost an art form (but really it&#39;s science).</p>
				<p>While I love hacking away, I&#39;m really excited to have a fun hobby that doesn&#39;t involve me staring at my computer. There&#39;s something so relaxing about spending my Saturday working in the sun. I&#39;m already planning on doing a rack of ribs for my next smoke...</p>

						<p>Sometimes in Meteor you need to use the same helper across templates. For example, if you have several views with admin controls, you might want a helper to help you control who sees those. It would be a pain to add that function to each template. Luckily, Meteor provides the ability to create a new global helper via UI.registerHelper.</p>
				<p>UI.registerHelper takes two parameters: the name of the helper as a string, and the function to be called. So to add my admin helper I might do something like this.</p>
				<pre><code class="lang-javascript">    UI.registerHelper(&#39;admin&#39;, function() {
				        return userIsAdmin();
				    });
				</code></pre>
				<p>UI.registerHelper is an excellent tool to prevent repeating code and to centralize global template functionality.</p>

				<p>To be made for eternity and forced to dwell in time is for mankind a tragedy of huge proportions. All within us cries for life and permanence, and everything around us reminds us of mortality and change. Yet that God has made us of the stuff of eternity is both a glory and a prophecy, a glory yet to be realized and a prophecy yet to be fulfilled.</p>

				<p>This thought is a major comfort when I&#39;m overwhelmed with a desire for permanence and an aversion to death or change.</p>

						<p><em>Fantastic</em> writing from Brian Phillips. I&#39;ll be honest I watched a maximum of 30 minutes of non-US soccer during the World Cup. Even then, I didn&#39;t watch the Belgium game. Soccer isn&#39;t my game, but I&#39;ll do just about anything that let&#39;s me drink and be patriotic.</p>
				<p>That said, this is a fantastic commentary of the significance of sport. Or really the significance of how we watch them. Here&#39;s the opening, no way you can read this and not read the article.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Watching sports is, among other things, a special way of experiencing time. Sport is like music or fiction or film in that, for a predetermined duration, it asks you to give it control over your emotions, to feel what it makes you feel. Unlike (most) forms of art, though, a game has no foreordained plan or plot or intention. The rules of a game impose a certain kind of order, but it’s different from the order of an artwork. A movie knows where it wants to take you; no one can say in advance where a game will go. All of its beauty, ugliness, boredom, and excitement, all of its rage and sadness emerge spontaneously out of the players’ competing desires to win. For however long the clock runs, your feelings are at the mercy of chance. This happens and then this happens and then this happens. You’re experiencing, in a contained and intensified way, something like the everyday movement of life.</p>
