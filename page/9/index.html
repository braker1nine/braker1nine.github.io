						<p>College football started it’s playoff last night, and that means it’s time for me to simulate my semifinal matchups. They came very close to being in line with an Ohio State v. Michigan State rematch semifinal. Since we got to see Ohio State v. Bama last night, I decided to just plug that final in. Here are the results...</p>

						<p>2014 has been an interesting year in the Brakebill household our biggest high and low probably came around the same time with Lauren’s graduation and our <a href="http://chrisbrakebill.com/2014/06/20/miscarriage/">miscarriage</a>. Those events have been rippling through our year as we plan for our future and cope with the loss of an expected child. It’s been another beautiful, fun, hard, and humbling year. I’d like to share some of the things I’ve liked this year. In the spirit of my <a href="threethings">newsletter</a>, a “thing” can be just about anything.</p>
				<h2 id="things-i-ve-liked">Things I’ve liked</h2>
				<h3 id="-proraso-shave-soap-http-www-italianbarber-com-proraso-shave-cream-150g-tub-menthol-and-eucalyptus-new-formula-"><a href="http://www.italianbarber.com/proraso-shave-cream-150g-tub-menthol-and-eucalyptus-new-formula">Proraso Shave Soap</a></h3>
				<p>I’m a new convert to this stuff but I already love it. I’ve been doing most of my shaving this year with a safety razor and some soap I bought on Etsy. I could never get a good lather with it. This stuff lathers fantastically and feels great.</p>
				<h3 id="merlin-mann">Merlin Mann</h3>
				<p><a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">Back to Work</a> and <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a> are two of my favorite podcasts of the year. Merlin (and John and Dan) are equal parts helpful, hilarious, and... real humans. I love finding people with absurdly different yet awesome view points and experiences from me.</p>
				<h3 id="coconut-oil">Coconut Oil</h3>
				<p>This stuff has so many great uses. My wife frequently uses it as cooking oil. You can add it to your <a href="2014/12/17/Oil-and-Coffee/">coffee</a>. You can use it as a pre shave oil. I’m sure if you search the internet you’ll find more interesting and uncomfortable uses.</p>
				<h3 id="pen-and-paper">Pen and Paper</h3>
				<p>I’ve become a bit of a <a href="http://bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a> convert this year. I don’t write down as much as I should and I’m still trying to reach a happy medium between paper tasks and keeping track long term in <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>.</p>
				<h3 id="-threes-https-itunes-apple-com-us-app-threes-id779157948-mt-8-and-monument-valley-https-itunes-apple-com-us-app-monument-valley-id728293409-mt-8-"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes!/id779157948?mt=8">Threes</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monument-valley/id728293409?mt=8">Monument Valley</a></h3>
				<p>Two best games of the year by far. Monument Valley is short but it’s just an incredible experience that made me say “whoa” many times. Threes is <strong>infinitely</strong> playable. I think I’ve played it every single day since it came out.</p>
				<h3 id="-the-martian-http-www-amazon-com-the-martian-novel-andy-weir-ebook-dp-b00emxbdma-"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Martian-Novel-Andy-Weir-ebook/dp/B00EMXBDMA">The Martian</a></h3>
				<p>My favorite book of the year by far. One of those ones you read in a day or two because it’s just that good. Can’t wait for the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3659388/">movie</a>.</p>
				<h3 id="-simple-http-www-simple-com-"><a href="http://www.simple.com">Simple</a></h3>
				<p>I’ve raved about them before. They’ve had a rough year as they made some major technical changes and the transition hasn’t been particularly smooth. But even with these issue, the product is still the best thing out there. I wouldn’t be able to manage our budget without it. And their customer support is second to none, which is hard to find in a bank.</p>
				<h3 id="-j-d-bentley-http-jdbentley-com-"><a href="http://jdbentley.com">J.D. Bentley</a></h3>
				<p>One of my favorite writers I’ve found this year. His writing is so thoughtful, concise, and easy to read. If I didn’t contain myself, I would end up sharing every single post he makes.</p>
				<h3 id="trippel-beers">Trippel Beers</h3>
				<p>I’ve long been a fan of New Belgium’s Trippel, but I’ve found that as a style the dubbel and trippel are my favorites. High alcohol content. Thick and wheaty. Not super hoppy. Everything I want in a beer.</p>
				<h3 id="-tomasino-s-pizza-http-www-tomasinospizza-com-"><a href="http://www.tomasinospizza.com">Tomasino’s Pizza</a></h3>
				<p>This is our local pizza joint and it’s quickly become one of my favorites. We still order frequently from Papa John’s, but Tomasino’s pizza is fantastic and it’s topped only by their garlic cheesy knots.</p>
				<h3 id="-feed-wrangler-http-feedwrangler-net-pod-wrangler-https-itunes-apple-com-us-app-pod-wrangler-podcasts-made-id692068382-mt-8-"><a href="http://feedwrangler.net">Feed Wrangler</a> / <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pod-wrangler-podcasts-made/id692068382?mt=8">Pod Wrangler</a></h3>
				<p>Two products I use on a daily basis for consuming RSS feeds and podcasts. If you are big on these things, the $19 per year is a steal.</p>
				<h3 id="-houzz-http-www-houzz-com-"><a href="http://www.houzz.com">Houzz</a></h3>
				<p>One of my most visited websites. Lauren and I are frequently talking about owning/building/renovating a home in the near future and Houzz is filled with education and inspiration. I’m just not someone who can accept “cookie cutter”, so I need more. Maybe not more. Probably less. But a less that is high quality. Houzz is an awesome way to find that.</p>
				<h3 id="-elizabeth-evelyn-kirby-http-localmilkblog-com-"><a href="http://localmilkblog.com">Elizabeth Evelyn Kirby</a></h3>
				<p>Whenever I talk about her I just refer to her as local milk. Her blog and instagram have been fantastic to follow. Beautiful homes and sights. Tasty recipes. And a style that is just... comforting and attractive. And she’s a fellow Tennessean.</p>
				<p>Later today or this weekend I’m going to share the podcasts/blogs I’m following heading into the new year. And I’m also going to talk about the shit I want to do or do better this year. Happy New Year y’all.</p>

						<p>I can’t decide if I’m terrified of these things or impatiently waiting for them.</p>
				<p>The concept of the self driving car is awesome. Eventually they will be safer and they will make road trips way more bearable. But we will need to be incredibly thoughtful when designing a system of self driving cars. You can’t have some sort of large scale hack giving away control of a large number of cars.</p>

						<p>Some great quotes from the people who made a holiday classic. I love this nugget...</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>For the dog and squirrel chase, we hired an animal trainer who trained them everyday for months to run through the set. When it came time to finally shoot what we&#39;ve been planning, I got out of my car and saw everyone standing in a huddle shaking their heads and I knew something was terribly wrong. I asked them what was going on and they said, &quot;We have a problem.&quot; Okay, what? &quot;The squirrel&#39;s dead.&quot; I said, &quot;Holy fuck, we&#39;re shooting that today!&quot; And the animal trainer turned and said, &quot;Ya know, they don&#39;t live that long.&quot; We still had to shoot the scene, so we used an untrained squirrel. It was just total chaos.</p>

						<p>In <a href="/2014/12/12/Georgia-Southern-has-it’s-day/">Round 1</a> of my college football playoff(s), Georgia Southern produced a couple major upsets.</p>
				<p>In Round 2 there were wildly different results between the 12-Team and 16-Team playoffs. In our 12-Team playoff, there’s something mostly resembling the committee’s selected final four, with Michigan State replacing Oregon. In the 16-Team playoff, Ohio State is the only final four team that made the committee’s list.</p>
				<p>Let’s look at the brackets...</p>
				<p><hr></p>
				<h3 id="12-team">12-Team</h3>
				<p><img src="/images/12_team_round2.png" alt="12 Team"></p>
				<p><hr></p>
				<h3 id="16-team">16-Team</h3>
				<p><img src="/images/16_team_round2.png" alt="16 Team"></p>
				<hr>
				
				<p>The next round is where things will get a little less accurate, as the <a href="http://www.ncaagamesim.com/fb_GameSimulator.asp">simulator</a> doesn’t allow for neutral site games. But this is for fun not accuracy, so I’ll just assume the games are closer to the higher seed and make them the home team.</p>
				<p>Note, the playoff takes a holiday break until new years. So I’ll simulate the semifinals on the same day as the actual semifinals</p>

					<h2 class="post__date">December 17th, 2014</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>I saw a coffee with coconut oil recipe in a recent <a href="http://tipsaholic.com/10-delightful-hot-drink-recipes-cold-nights/">tipsaholic</a> post, and I’d heard of <a href="http://nextshark.com/5-reasons-why-everyone-is-putting-butter-in-their-coffee/">Bulletproof Coffee</a> on <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/195">Back to Work</a> not too long ago.</p>
				<p>When something like that crosses my path a few times, I figure it might be worth a try. So this morning I put a tablespoon of coconut oil in with my milk as I steamed it to go in my coffee.</p>
				<p>The result? Delicious. I can’t speak much for the health benefits, but I enjoyed the coffee. I definitely felt pretty full this morning, but any immediately benefits I felt can probably be attributed to the placebo effect.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, I feel like crap tonight but I think that’s me getting sick rather than the coconut oil. I’m going to keep trying this in my coffee and see if I notice any significant changes.</p>
