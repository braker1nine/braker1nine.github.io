				<blockquote>
				<p>What happens in countries where there’s real competition? In the UK, where incumbent provider BT is required to allow competitors to use its wired broadband network, home internet service prices are as low as £2.50 a month, or just over $4. In South Korea, where wireless giants SK Telecom and LG Uplus are locked in a fierce technology battle, customers have access to the fastest mobile networks in the world — up to 300Mbps, compared to a theoretical max of 80Mbps on Verizon that’s actually more like 15 or 20mbps in the real world.</p>
				<p>And Americans pay more for these slower wireless speeds than anyone else in the world: in Germany, where customers can freely switch between carriers by swapping SIM cards, T-Mobile customers pay just $1.18 per Mbps of speed. In the US, our mostly incompatible wireless networks lock customers in with expensive handsets they can’t take elsewhere, allowing AT&amp;T and Verizon to charge around $4 per Mbps each and Sprint to clock in at an insane $7.50.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Those two paragraphs are so depressing to me.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>So there’s the entire problem, expressed in four simple ideas: the internet is a utility, there is zero meaningful competition to provide that utility to Americans, all internet providers should be treated equally, and the FCC is doing a miserably ineffective job. The United States should lead the world in broadband deployment and speeds: we should have the lowest prices, the best service, and the most competition. We should have the freest speech and the loudest voices, the best debate and the soundest policy. We are home to the most innovative technology companies in the world, and we should have the broadband networks to match.</p>
				<p>We should stop fucking it up.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>If you want to do something, email the FCC chair at tom.wheeler@fcc.com and call 1-888-225-5322. Calls to your <a href="http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">representatives</a> and <a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">senators</a> are always good too.</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>BlackBerry’s QNX platform is the base on which the BlackBerry 10 operating system is built, but it’s also much more than that. Before it was morphed into smartphone software, QNX was an in-car operating system that powered infotainment systems in a wide range of vehicles. It still is, and as N4BB confirmed on Tuesday, it’s also the foundation for Apple’s new CarPlay product.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Amazing that the value for QNX may not come from Blackberry mobile devices, but from being the go to in-car operating system. Add this onto news that Ford Sync is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-22/ford-said-to-swap-blackberry-s-qnx-for-microsoft-in-sync-system.html">planning to drop</a> Microsoft for QNX, and it looks like Blackberry is building itself a nice little niche, though I&#39;m not sure how profitable it is.</p>
				<p>I never would have believed this a year or so ago, but is it possible that Blackberry could become an acquisition target for Apple?</p>

						<p>Yesterday Apple <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/03/03Apple-Rolls-Out-CarPlay-Giving-Drivers-a-Smarter-Safer-More-Fun-Way-to-Use-iPhone-in-the-Car.html">introduced</a> CarPlay, their solution for connecting your iPhone to your vehicle&#39;s stereo.</p>
				<p>My first thought is damn that UI is beautiful. As someone who recently bought an aftermarket stereo, I can say that the makers of these things are stuck in the 90s when it comes to interface design. Even on touch screens the buttons are small, the designs are hideous, and UX is an afterthought. It will be interesting to see if this platform moves beyond built-in stereos.</p>
				<p>I&#39;m thrilled that Apple is starting to dip it&#39;s toes into this space. I&#39;ve always been a bit bearish on the phone as the hub for the car stereo, but I&#39;m starting to rethink that.</p>

				<p>I have just sorted through the App Store and settled on trying out your app. I open it up and you immediately ask if you can send me Push Notifications? I have no context about what these are going to be used for or why they might be useful to me.</p>

				<p>I recently got similar advice about my iPhone game. I&#39;d never really thought twice about asking immediately, but it really is an annoying experience. I&#39;m looking for a better time to ask for this than at launch. Possibly when you make your first move. I might even follow David&#39;s advice and make it something you explicitly enable.</p>

						<p>Supertop, makers of <a href="http://castro.fm/">Castro</a>, have been experimenting with prompting users to review the app in the release notes. And it&#39;s worked.</p>
				<p>I have to admit I&#39;m surprised by this. I&#39;d expect few people see the release notes because of auto updating, and even fewer read them. Maybe it&#39;s more than I expect or maybe a high percentage of those who read them appreciate that prompt and leave a review.</p>
