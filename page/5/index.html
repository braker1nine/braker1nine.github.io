						<p>The transformation this app has taken going from ScoreCenter to SportsCenter to ESPN is just fantastic. Personally, I loved putting the SportsCenter brand on the app. It just felt right. Regardless of naming, the teams that have worked on this have built an awesome experience.</p>

						<p>I’ve been quite effusive about <a href="http://www.simple.com">Simple</a> since I first signed up. There are two particular features of Simple that make it <em>incredibly</em> powerful as a financial planning tool: Goals and Safe-to-Spend.</p>
				<p>Simple allows you to create goals for any expense you’re planning. It works like this. You name your goal, set an amount you’d like to save and then decide whether you want to save it now or save it over time until a specific date. This is where Safe-to-Spend comes in, because any money that is put into that goal is no longer available in your Safe-to-Spend total. If you choose to save over time, Simple will gradually move money from Safe-to-Spend and into the goal.</p>
				<p><img src="/images/simple/createGoalOverTime.png" alt="Creating a goal"></p>
				<p>The psychological power of this setup can’t be overstated. I know that I can see my actual balance and I may have plenty of money in my account, but if that Safe-to-Spend total is low then it’s hard to spend anymore. Not only would I feel like I’m spending money I don’t have, but I could see in my goals the things that I’m taking money away from if I spend beyond my Safe-to-Spend. Effectively it’s a digital version of Dave Ramsey’s <a href="http://www.daveramsey.com/article/dave-ramseys-envelope-system/lifeandmoney_budgeting/">envelope system</a>. </p>
				<p>Also in the Goals section of the website, there’s this fantastic little popover that shows you how much money will be put in Goals until your next paycheck. In my opinion, this information is tremendously underemphasized.</p>
				<p><img src="/images/simple/paycheck.png" alt="Nice preview of your status until the next paycheck"></p>
				<p>So how do I use Simple? First off you have to get around one painful fact. Simple doesn’t have recurring goals. You can’t say a goal occurs once a month or year and have a goal automatically created. So let’s break down what different types of goals I have.</p>
				<h2 id="yearly-bills">Yearly Bills</h2>
				<p>Evernote, Dropbox, Fastmail, and the list goes on. If I can get a cheaper bill by going yearly, I usually do it. Once a year I create a goal for these items. Easy to maintain. And you’re never surprised by a big unexpected expense. You’ve been saving all year, and that big expense is just a blip.</p>
				<h2 id="monthly-bills">Monthly Bills</h2>
				<p>I started out trying to maintain the monthly things by actually creating a goal each month. But that takes a lot of work and can get a little confusing within a given pay period. So it’s better to handle these yearly as well. Many monthly bills, like rent, cable, internet, or mobile phone, have the same cost every month. With these you can calculate a total for the year and create a goal. Then by the time each bill rolls around, you should have just the right amount to pay it from the goal.</p>
				<p>Others, like utilities, are variable. For the variable bills it helps if you have a year’s worth of bills to look through, then you can estimate what a year is going to cost and get pretty close. What’s important is that you have a decently close number, and your goal will prevent that monthly bill from making a dent in your Safe-to-Spend.</p>
				<h2 id="budgeting">Budgeting</h2>
				<p>Another type of goal I create is a yearly budget for certain categories. So I create a goal once a year for things like groceries, gas, tithing, and fun with my wife. Again, you’re looking for solid estimates here, not exact totals. If you have to make some adjustments throughout the year that’s okay. It forces you to really think about your spending on these things and be aware of it.</p>
				<h2 id="one-off-expenses">One off expenses</h2>
				<p>You can create goals for other expected or desired expenses. I have goals for my wife’s birthday, our anniversary, and Christmas. I can save all year for these things and not be caught off guard when they come around. If you are thinking you want to upgrade to a new phone next year, you can start saving now. This is how I make buying phones off contract a reasonable reality. Instead of a sudden major expense, or paying my carrier more every month to make that phone cheaper up front, I pay myself a little every day until iPhone launch day comes.</p>
				<h2 id="a-cushion">A cushion</h2>
				<p>When you start really using goals, you end up with a nice chunk of money in them that isn’t in your Safe-to-Spend. What’s nice is it gives you this cushion of immediately available money. If an unexpected expense does come in, you can pull some money out of a few goals and adjust your expectations. Maybe spend less at Christmas. Or cancel/reduce a service. Or just take the money out of the goal and know you’ll be able to compensate gradually. Instead of taking on credit card debt, you take on self debt. It’s so much nicer to know exactly what you’re sacrificing rather than blindly spending out of a single pool of money. <em>(Unless you have an actual pool of money, then you just do you)</em></p>
				<p>Simple has been a <em>huge</em> boon to my financial management. Bills and large expenses are easy to plan for and track and my stress levels are greatly reduced. I don’t have to plan and save in a spreadsheet, Simple does it for me. One might say it makes managing your finances... Simple?</p>

I see your struggle in a way the flesh-shakers simply can’t, and I understand your plight, especially when someone is attempting to cajole you into dancing.

				<p>Any creative endeavor is highly non-linear, but the sharing of it almost always skips a lot of the actual work that goes into it. That’s ok; a clear progression makes for a good story that’s easy to tell. But don’t judge your reality against someone else’s compressed work</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is something I needed to be reminded of on a daily basis. I see great writers like John Gruber and Shawn Blanc cranking out awesome stuff. I see devs and designers like Marco Arment and Greg Wohlwend cranking out awesome stuff. And I start comparing myself. I look at my process and see how messy and shitty it is and how it doesn’t compare to their results. People who do great work do a lot of hard messy work first. If you want to do great work, just do work, power through that hard shitty stuff and get better.</p>

						<p>I’ve always been a huge fan of C. I have no doubt that my C skills aren’t what the used to be, but speed aside there’s something fantastic about how much C lets you get your hands dirty and forces you to know how every little thing works. Sure it’s just another abstraction, but I like to think it’s the perfect amount of abstraction.</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>Remember that nothing is magic. Even though it seems like you’re working at the top of a stack of impenetrable abstractions, they’re made by people (who were probably rushed, or drunk, or both). Learn how they work, then figure out how to minimize your dependence on them.</p>

					<h1 class="post__title"><a href="/Personal-Manifesto/">Personal Manifesto</a></h1>
					<h2 class="post__date">January 30th, 2015</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>One of the things I wanted to do better in 2015 was write in my journal. I’ve been following <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/01/01/jumpstart-your-journaling-a-31-day-challenge/">this</a> excellent list of prompts from the Art of Manliness. Yesterday’s challenge was to write a personal manifesto and it’s something that really resonated with me.</p>
				<p>There are so many things in life pulling us in a million directions. If you aren’t intentional about what matters to you and what you’re striving to make of your life every day, you can get lost in the sea of crap. Writing a <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/02/13/how-and-why-to-write-your-own-personal-manifesto/">personal manifesto</a> can give you a rubric for spending time and making decisions.</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>The word manifesto traces its roots to the Latin manifestum, which means clear or conspicuous.  A manifesto is defined as a declaration of one’s beliefs, opinions, motives, and intentions. It is simply a document that an organization or person writes that declares what is important to them.</p>
				<p>A manifesto functions as both a statement of principles and a bold, sometimes rebellious, call to action. By causing people to evaluate the gap between those principles and their current reality, the manifesto challenges assumptions, fosters commitment, and provokes change.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I’m still working out the details, and will be for some time, but I wanted to start by just laying out the areas of my life I want to address in my manifesto</p>
				<ul>
				<li>My relationship with God</li>
				<li>My relationships with family</li>
				<li>My use of goods and resources</li>
				<li>Care of my body</li>
				<li>Service to community</li>
				<li>Responsible use of technology</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I’m still sussing out what each of these means. A couple of them are related, so I might try to fold them into each other for simplicity. But these are the areas I landed on that are important to me. That I want to be conscious of every day. One aspect that’s missing is my work. Not because it isn’t important, but because I’m still trying to thoughtfully address it. I want to nail the essence of why my work matters to me and where I pull the meaning from.</p>

						<p>We’ve started using Agile in our team at ESPN, and the experience has made me see just how discombobulated my strategy for working on side projects is. Starting this week, I’m taking some Agile-ish concepts and getting them into my workflow.</p>
				<p>One of the problems I have is I’ve got two (well, three, but one has been way on the back burner) projects going on at once and I’m constantly going back and forth on this and that. This context switching from day to day even makes it almost impossible to make real progress.</p>
				<p>Each week I’m doing a little sprint. Each sprint will focus on one project. For now I’m just going to cycle through all three projects week by week. Taking away my ability to just hack on the little thing I want to hack on will help me get shit done. If the nature of deadlines or tasks that need to be done requires it, I will adjust my plan a bit. But I want to make sure I’ve got my weeks’ planned well in advance.</p>
				<p>I’m pulling my projects and tasks into <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> and doing my planning there. I <em>really</em> want to love Omnifocus, but it feels like the learning curve is so steep. So if you have any tips or workflows for Omnifocus, I’d love to hear them. If it ends up creating too much friction I’ll just move back to <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a>, which has been my old standby for years now.</p>
				<p>Maintaining discipline with a project you work on alone is tough. It’s time to get proactive about my planning.</p>
