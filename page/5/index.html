				<p>What do you do if you’re Tennessee athletic director Dave Hart and a coach who has won 70 percent of his career games, has made more NCAA Tournament appearances (22) than the Vols have made in their history (20) and has won everywhere he’s been (George Mason, Providence, Clemson, Texas) drops into your lap?</p>
				<p>You hire him, that’s what you do.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>We all love Bruce Pearl, but it’s pretty clear that Rick Barnes has had a much better career. How can you argue with a coach who has more NCAA Tournament appearances than your entire program?</p>

				<p>Some really great nuggets in here for creating an effective creative workplace. No dickheads is obvious. But many of their guidelines are under appreciated in today’s workplace. Eating and cooking together, reading fiction, sharing your family with your coworkers and your coworkers with your family. These things can turn where you work into more than just that place you go to earn your living. They cultivate a place where you experience joy and growth. Where your work feeds your soul and your soul feeds your work. And that’s how you get shit done.</p>

				<p>We are our first users — we’re using the workflows and environment that we set up for ourselves to make good decisions on behalf of ourselves, our families, our clients, and our users. We know the consequences of decision fatigue and poor choices better than most. We’re never going to eliminate decision fatigue from our own lives, or from anyone else’s, but by changing our own habits and lessening our own decision fatigue, we can make better choices more consistently throughout the day, which leads to a better experience for everyone.</p>

				<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about decision fatigue lately and how it might affect me. I’m trying to get to the more important things as early in the day as possible.</p>

				<p>This seems to be becoming a depressingly common story. Guy or girl creates something cool or popular. Gets an uncomfortable amount of hate over how they manage it. Checks out. Lucky for Persson it netted him well north of a billion dollars. But no amount of money makes that kind of hate feel any better.</p>
				<p>As I think about the small possibility of <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a> being really successful, I do get a little terrified.

				<p>The star exploded more than nine billion years ago on the other side of the universe, too far for even the Hubble to see without special help from the cosmos. In this case, however, light rays from the star have been bent and magnified by the gravity of an intervening cluster of galaxies so that multiple images of it appear.</p>
				<p>Four of them are arranged in a tight formation known as an Einstein Cross surrounding one of the galaxies in the cluster. Since each light ray follows a different path from the star to here, each image in the cross represents a slightly different moment in the supernova explosion.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The way light, gravity, and time work at this scale is absolutely fascinating and mind bending.</p>

				<p>The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits mandate that anything sold as bourbon must be:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Made from a grain mixture (the mash) that is at least 51% corn.</li>
				<li>Aged in new, charred oak barrels.</li>
				<li>Distilled to no more than 160 proof, or 80% alcohol.</li>
				<li>Entered into a barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof, or 62.5% alcohol.</li>
				<li>Bottled at 80 proof or more, at least 40% alcohol.</li>
				<li>Made in the United States.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Notice that, although most bourbon is from Kentucky and it’s known as Kentucky’s whiskey, bourbon doesn’t have to be made in Kentucky at all. It can be made anywhere in the United States. Nevertheless, many bourbons made outside of Kentucky choose not to call themselves bourbon, like Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels is, by definition, a bourbon whiskey, but they market themselves as Tennessee Whiskey.</p>

				<p>I find myself more and more interested in urban design. Having lived most of my life in Knoxville and Orlando, I’m very used to cities built for cars. But there are parts of each city that are becoming more pedestrian friendly. Those parts are really my favorite places to be.</p>
				<p>For me it’s a tough balance. I really want to be in those areas, but I also want to live on a nice big chunk of greenery</p>
