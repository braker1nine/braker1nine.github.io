				<p>As designers and product builders, we are told to empathize with our users in order to create awesome experiences for the web and beyond. I propose we take a look at the other side of empathy, and make an effort to empathize with the creators behind the products, features, or designs triggering those rage-tweet reactions seen across many a timeline.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is something I&#39;ve become a lot more aware of in the past couple of years. Working on a product that is used by millions of people, I know what it&#39;s like to see people bashing what you&#39;ve built. It sucks. I do my best to think before I tweet critically and angrily about a piece of software I&#39;m using.</p>

				<p>When I was younger, it was easy to put people I looked up to on a pedestal. Bosses at work, pastors at church, my favourite bands. That is easy to do from afar, but the closer you get to people, the more you see the real person; the flaws, the hurting, and the mess as much as the good things.</p>

				<p>Great stuff from Chris Bowler. We&#39;re all just messy people.</p>

						<p>A lot to absorb here, but it&#39;s something that I do feel like resonates with my experiences. Definitely worth a read. The end though is a bit disturbing:</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Yet seeing the grotesque animosity towards people like me from liberals over the small-beer Hobby Lobby decision compels me to face up to the fact that the only political force standing between me, my church, and my community, and a State dominated by people who think we traditional church people are cretins who deserve to be pushed around, is Republicans.</p>

				<p>Long story short, an astronaut gets stranded on Mars. He engineers and potato farms to survive while NASA and his fellow astronauts try to figure out how to get him home.</p>

				<p>We mustn’t be afraid of failing nor of being rejected, and we must place more value on the act of creating so we can find joy in the journey and develop a lifetime of experience in making things.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Shawn has some <strong>great</strong> advice on creativity. I can feel every one of the stiflers of creativity that he mentions getting a foothold in my work. I&#39;m going to try to be more intentional about keeping those things at bay.</p>

				<blockquote>
				<p>Creative people, in my experience, are plagued with doubt. This is awful! they all think, definitely including myself. It’s a very personal thing, and it’s insidious because you’re the only one who gets to see the first drafts, and the refinements, and whole, messy stop and start and double-back of producing something worthwhile. It’s hard to keep in mind that the first version of everything is garbage, and the final version of everything is still garbage to the person who made it.</p>

				<p>I absolutely struggle with this every single day.</p>

						<blockquote>
				<p>My father used to always say, “Ask questions, don’t make assumptions.&quot; Questions invite conversations, stimulate thinking, break down barriers, create positive energy and show your willingness to understand and learn. Questions show humility, acknowledgement and respect for the past, and give you greater insights into both the business and individuals. And don’t be afraid to ask personal questions or share a few of your personal details. </p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Some great advice that I could follow more often.</p>
