				<p>Once you begin the process of slowly shedding unnecessary possessions, it becomes intoxicating. Your living space slowly becomes simpler and less cluttered, which has the unexpected effect of de-cluttering your head. It becomes a lifestyle.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I’ve been feeling this sort of tugging at my soul for the past couple of months. I have too much stuff. Too much clutter. And that stuff tends to begat more stuff. I need to replace that stuff. Upgrade it.</p>
				<p>I’ve been trying to evaluate the things in our home. To look for things that I don’t love to look at or need. I’m going to try to share some of my struggle as I attempt to reduce my stuff.</p>

					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>Unfortunately it’s hard to call my attempt at NaNoWriMo anything but a failure. I wrote about 6 super short chapters of my “novel” and inertia plus the holidays stopped me in my tracks.</p>
				<p>The biggest problem I found each day was my fear before even getting started. I felt like I had already written a bunch of shit and all I could muster up was more of it. I also had this crippling fear of writing myself into a corner. Sticking myself in a position where my story was screwed. The point of NaNoWriMo is to power through this and if you don’t like your plot at the end, you can edit it. But I couldn’t fight off the fear that I was going to write something dumb (this not doing something for the fear that I’ll do it poorly is an all too common story in my life).</p>
				<p>I’m thinking about keeping the writing going throughout the year and maybe trying to add to the novel once a week. Nothing to ambitious. Just consistently sticking to the habit, if for nothing else but the habit’s sake.</p>

						<p>One of the things that is driving me crazy about my iPhone is websites in Safari auto redirecting to their native app. This is the kind of thing that seems great in theory, but it results in a really shitty experience. </p>
				<p>The primary culprit for me is Pinterest. If I open a link to a board or user or pin on Pinterest, that tab redirects me to the app. Okay cool. I’m logged in in the app. I can check out whatever I was looking at. But if I don’t immediately go close that tab I’m in for trouble the next time I open Safari. The tab will have been purged from memory so it’s reloaded and I’m immediately forced back into the app.</p>
				<p>What’s the solution? To me there are two options. </p>
				<ol>
				<li><p>Close the tab. If you’re directing me out of Safari, then I probably want that context to be closed as I move into another. I’m not sure if devs can do this, but if they can’t Apple should do it. The site is taking me to their app, close that Safari tab. This is the simplest solution, but I think there are marginally decent arguments to be made that you don’t want that tab closed in every situation. I think?</p>
				</li>
				<li><p>Provide developers the ability to show a native extension-like popover view that gives some context. For Pinterest it might be some basic board or information with a small photo. Not the stupid little, “Hey we have an app. Go view it” functionality that Apple provides, but a fully native, developer provided view that lets users decide if they want to load the app. No forcing a user out of the browser and into the app.</p>

				<p>We visit yet another cafe. My last request to Slotboom is to show me what he would do if he wanted to really harm me. He asks me to go to Live.com (the Microsoft email site) and enter a random username and password. A few seconds later, the information I just typed appears on his screen. “Now I have the login details of your email account,” Slotboom says. “The first thing I would do is change the password of your account and indicate to other services you use that I have forgotten my password. Most people use the same email account for all services. And those new passwords will then be sent to your mailbox, which means I will have them at my disposal as well.” We do the same for Facebook: Slotboom is able to intercept the login name and password I entered with relative ease.</p>

						<p>Developers like control. We like things to be just how we like. It tends to take some time to get things that way. This becomes a bit of a problem when you need to do a clean OS install or move to a new machine. How do you restore shell settings? Install node packages? Install your favorite apps?</p>
				<p>There are a lot of solutions out there for automating system setups like <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> and <a href="https://boxen.github.com">Boxen</a> but those seem a little heavy for a personal setup (though I’m open to suggestions otherwise).</p>
				<p>In 2012, I had the chance to take a sort of git crash course from Github’s <a href="https://twitter.com/matthewmccull">Matthew McCullough</a> and encountered his system setup <a href="https://github.com/matthewmccullough/dotfiles">process</a>. I’ve been using the zsh aliases and oh-my-zsh for a long while with some minor tweaks, but after a recent clean install I decided to really make it work.</p>
				<p><a href="http://brew.sh">Brew</a> is a fantastic tool for installing packages that you want. But the real game changer for me was <a href="http://caskroom.io">Cask</a>. It installs Mac applications automatically right from the script. You’re limited to apps that have been added by the community and you can’t install the apps you’ve bought on the Mac App Store, but it’s a great start.</p>
				<p>Now when I load up a fresh OS X install all I have to do is install Dropbox and let it sync, go into my dotfiles folder and run </p>
				<pre>_setupdotfiles.zsh</pre>
				
				<p>And I’m set. I’m sure I’ll find improvements along the way. But I thought I’d share <a href="https://github.com/braker1nine/dotfiles">my setup</a> so it might benefit someone else.</p>

					<h2 class="post__date">October 16th, 2014</h2>

						<p>A while back, Dan Benjamin and Merlin Mann discussed how blue light affects our sleep on <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/160">Back to Work</a>. It was a really fantastic discussion and it resonated with my own experiences. I tended to sit up late at night, staring at my phone and wondering why I wasn’t sleepy.</p>
				<p>They link <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-light-affects-our-sleep/#axzz2uMAnScJH">here</a> where Mark Sisson dives into the science of why blue light keeps us awake:</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>Blue light regulates our secretion of melatonin, the sleep hormone. Exposed to blue light, we limit the production of melatonin, and we stay alert and awake; in the absence of blue light, melatonin production ramps up, and we get sleepy. This system worked quite well for a long time. Reddish light from fire (our formerly primary source of nighttime illumination) has little to no effect on melatonin production, so sleep wasn’t disrupted when we relied on fire. These days, though, we’re subject to a steady barrage of blue light. During the day, blue light (natural or unnatural) isn’t much of a problem because we’re supposed to be awake, but at night, when we’re “supposed” to be getting ready to sleep, we tend to sit in front of blue light-emanating appliances, and our sleep suffers for it.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I’m generally a skeptical guy, but this felt anecdotally right to me. I already had <a href="https://justgetflux.com">f.lux</a> installed on my MacBook and felt at night as if <em>it was making me</em> tired.</p>
				<p>In addition, I moved my phone charger to the office and left it there at night. Not having it next to me has taken away the temptation to look at it. That is a temptation I cannot resist. <strong>IT’S SO CLOSE. I CAN REACH IT INDY.</strong> Since my Fitbit broke, I’ve moved my phone back into the bedroom for alarm purposes, but I keep it across the room. It’s actually fantastic because it keeps me from staring at the phone at night and forces me to get up in the morning to shut it off. The only time I keep my phone on the nightstand anymore is when I’m on call.</p>
				<p>I was frequently laying in bed, unable to fall asleep, and then finally getting up to go downstairs and read myself into a coma (Kindle FTW), but I haven’t done that in months it seems. I still have some nights where I struggle to sleep, but that’s usually due to shoulder pain and having another human taking up space in the bed. I like to really spread my elbows out, and they can do damage. <strong>(MARRIAGE TIP: Use separate blankets. Thank me later).</strong></p>

				<p>The greatest evil is this: pride, avarice, lust, envy, gluttony, anger, and sloth. Avoid those and you’ll arrive at their polar opposites, which are the greatest good: humility, charity, chastity, kindness, temperance, patience, and diligence.</p>
				<p>If you lack purpose, if your life is a mess, then you are surely practicing, in some measure, the evils and failing to practice the good. There’s no easy fix for that. There’s no expert for that. There are no “12-steps” or “30-days” that can turn that around for you. It’s a choice made daily and fought for by the minute. It’s exhausting.</p>
