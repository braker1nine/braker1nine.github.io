						<p>Just for fun, I thought I would go through and simulate my playoffs as they would happen. I&#39;m using <a href="http://www.ncaagamesim.com/fb_GameSimulator.asp">this</a> fun little tool to simulate all of the games. I thought about simulating them multiple times to get a more accurate look at how the game would go, but what is college sports without the fun of how random it can be.</p>
				<p>Up this week, we have round 1 of my two playoff versions. Let’s look at what happened...</p>
				<p><hr></p>
				<h3 id="12-team">12 Team</h3>
				<p><img src="/images/12_team_round1.png" alt="12 Team"></p>
				<p>The 12 team bracket ended up with mostly chalk, but Georgia Southern pulled off a huge upset of Baylor in double OT.</p>
				<p><hr></p>
				<h3 id="16-team">16 Team</h3>
				<p><img src="/images/16_team_round1.png" alt="16 Team"></p>
				<p>The 16 team bracket also saw Georgia Southern pulling off an overtime upset, this time against #1 Alabama. I like this playoff idea a little more every day.</p>

				<p>It seems ridiculous that reviewing a bunch of headphones would bring this degree of controversy, but that wasn’t really the cause. I often speak and write with arrogance, absolutes, and generalizations that I don’t intend, and often don’t even realize I’ve done unless someone points it out. It’s probably the biggest flaw in my writing and personality, and while I’ve been trying to write (and think) with more qualifiers, fewer absolutes, and more consideration and inclusion of other viewpoints, I still have a long way to go.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I’ve had this sitting in my queue for a while, but this is some fantastic and <em>real</em> self evaluation. I will fully admit to being annoyed my Marco’s ‘arrogance’ and ‘absolutes’ frequently. Despite the fact that we surely disagree on many things, I’ve always respected him and this just makes me respect him <em>way</em> more.</p>
				<p>We (myself as much as anyone) could all use more open, honest looks at ourselves. And we would do well to share what we see with the people around us, because they’ve likely seen it and been affected by it.</p>

						<blockquote>
				<p>Do the math and UAB appears to be overestimating the supposed $7.25 million cost of having a football team in 2018-19. In fact, it looks like UAB football is a break-even and/or slightly profitable proposition, without even considering merchandise sales or other, hidden sources of revenue. (For instance, one recent FBS entrant has a $2 million-a-year concession deal with Pepsi, yet credits those revenues to university food services.)</p>

						<p>The good news is we get our first college football playoff this year. The bad news is it’s still a bit imperfect. I can’t seem to find my playoff plan on the internet anymore so I’ll give a quick summary here. </p>
				<p>I think college basketball has it mostly right. Conference champions deserve a shot, no matter the conference. In general, if you’re a conference champion you’re a winner. Previously I’ve been a support of 16 teams, but with the total number of conferences down to 10, I’m open to a 12 team playoff. I’m going to frame out what both scenarios would look like.</p>
				<h2 id="conference-champions">Conference Champions</h2>
				<p>First things first, let’s look at who is getting the automatic bids into our tournament.</p>
				<table><tr><td>AAC</td><td>Memphis</td></tr><tr><td>ACC</td><td>FSU</td></tr><tr><td>Big XII</td><td>Baylor</td></tr><tr><td>Big Ten</td><td>Ohio State</td></tr><tr><td>Conference USA</td><td>Marshall</td></tr><tr><td>MAC</td><td>Northern Illinois</td></tr><tr><td>Mountain West</td><td>Boise State</td></tr><tr><td>Pac 12</td><td>Oregon</td></tr><tr><td>SEC</td><td>Alabama</td></tr><tr><td>Sun Belt</td><td>Georgia Southern</td></tr></table>
				
				<h2 id="at-large-spots">At Large Spots</h2>
				<p>So we’ve got 10 conference champions that leaves us 2 or 6 at large spots, depending on the playoff format.</p>
				<p><strong>Top At-Large Teams</strong>
				TCU, Michigan State, Kansas State, Mississippi State, Georgia Tech, Wisconsin, Missouri, Arizona, Mississippi, Georgia, UCLA</p>
				<p>So let’s just rank the top teams here. There’s a lot of debate to be made here, and my goal isn’t to determine the absolute best field but to show off the format. So forgive me if you think my at large picks are dumb</p>
				<ol>
				<li>TCU</li>
				<li>Michigan State</li>
				<li>Kansas State</li>
				<li>Mississippi</li>
				<li>Mississippi State</li>
				<li>Arizona</li>
				</ol>
				<p>TCU and Michigan State are easy. Both teams’ only losses are to teams already in the field. Honestly think Mississippi State had a better season than Ole Miss, but that head to head gives Ole Miss the edge. Both had great seasons in a tough conference.</p>
				<p>Kansas State might be the best three loss team in the country. Two losses to top Big XII teams in the field and a close home loss to Auburn. I’m putting them third, partly because they deserve it and partly for better 16 team match ups. Arizona sneaks in despite the rough showing in the Pac 12 title game.</p>
				<h2 id="ranking-the-field">Ranking the Field</h2>
				<p>So that gives us our field of 12 to 16 teams. Let’s rank all 16 top to bottom. (again these are my rankings and I’m sure <em>many</em> will disagree)</p>
				<table><thead><tr><th>16 Team</th><th>12 Team</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1. Alabama</td><td>1. Alabama</td></tr><tr><td>2. Oregon</td><td>2. Oregon</td></tr><tr><td>3. Florida State</td><td>3. Florida State</td></tr><tr><td>4. Ohio State</td><td>4. Ohio State</td></tr><tr><td>5. Baylor</td><td>5. Baylor</td></tr><tr><td>6. TCU</td><td>6. TCU</td></tr><tr><td>7. Michigan State</td><td>7. Michigan State</td></tr><tr><td>8. Kansas State</td><td>8. Boise State</td></tr><tr><td>9. Mississippi</td><td>9. Marshall</td></tr><tr><td>10. Mississippi State</td><td>10. Northern Illinois</td></tr><tr><td>11. Arizona</td><td>11. Memphis</td></tr><tr><td>12. Boise State</td><td>12. Georgia Southern</td></tr><tr><td>13. Marshall</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>14. Northern Illinois</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15. Memphis</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>16. Georgia Southern</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
				
				
				<h2 id="the-brackets">The Brackets</h2>
				<p><img src="/images/real-college-football-playoff/16_team.png" alt="16 Team"></p>
				<p><img src="/images/real-college-football-playoff/12_team.png" alt="12 Team"></p>
				<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
				<p>With the number of conferences down to 10, I think I&#39;m changing my tune a little this year. I&#39;d really prefer the 12 team playoff. I imagine we won&#39;t see any new FBS conferences anytime soon so it&#39;s a safe bet for the future. And I think it creates more competitive first round matchups.</p>
				<p>Both formats it would likely mean a reduction in the number of regular season games. I think at least one game would have to be dropped off, but maybe two. Frankly this is my biggest concern, because losing those games could be tough financiallly on a lot of teams. Hopefully a profit share of the playoff games could compensate for that.</p>
				<p>So if you dropped off a game, then you would play two rounds at school sites before Christmas and two rounds at neutral site after New Years. There are a lot of logisitics to work out, but rewarding the conference champions will make for a fantastic playoff.</p>

					<h2 class="post__date">December 3rd, 2014</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>Unfortunately it’s hard to call my attempt at NaNoWriMo anything but a failure. I wrote about 6 super short chapters of my “novel” and inertia plus the holidays stopped me in my tracks.</p>
				<p>The biggest problem I found each day was my fear before even getting started. I felt like I had already written a bunch of shit and all I could muster up was more of it. I also had this crippling fear of writing myself into a corner. Sticking myself in a position where my story was screwed. The point of NaNoWriMo is to power through this and if you don’t like your plot at the end, you can edit it. But I couldn’t fight off the fear that I was going to write something dumb (this not doing something for the fear that I’ll do it poorly is an all too common story in my life).</p>
				<p>I’m thinking about keeping the writing going throughout the year and maybe trying to add to the novel once a week. Nothing to ambitious. Just consistently sticking to the habit, if for nothing else but the habit’s sake.</p>

						<p>One of the things that is driving me crazy about my iPhone is websites in Safari auto redirecting to their native app. This is the kind of thing that seems great in theory, but it results in a really shitty experience. </p>
				<p>The primary culprit for me is Pinterest. If I open a link to a board or user or pin on Pinterest, that tab redirects me to the app. Okay cool. I’m logged in in the app. I can check out whatever I was looking at. But if I don’t immediately go close that tab I’m in for trouble the next time I open Safari. The tab will have been purged from memory so it’s reloaded and I’m immediately forced back into the app.</p>
				<p>What’s the solution? To me there are two options. </p>
				<ol>
				<li><p>Close the tab. If you’re directing me out of Safari, then I probably want that context to be closed as I move into another. I’m not sure if devs can do this, but if they can’t Apple should do it. The site is taking me to their app, close that Safari tab. This is the simplest solution, but I think there are marginally decent arguments to be made that you don’t want that tab closed in every situation. I think?</p>
				</li>
				<li><p>Provide developers the ability to show a native extension-like popover view that gives some context. For Pinterest it might be some basic board or information with a small photo. Not the stupid little, “Hey we have an app. Go view it” functionality that Apple provides, but a fully native, developer provided view that lets users decide if they want to load the app. No forcing a user out of the browser and into the app.</p>
