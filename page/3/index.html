					<h2 class="post__date">June 12th, 2015</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>At the beginning of this year I worked on my own <a href="http://chrisbrakebill.com/personal-manifesto/">personal manifesto</a>, a sort guide for how I live my life and what I prioritize. Now that we’re halfway through the year, I wanted to take a look back at it and see what I’m doing well and where I could do better.</p>
				<h2 id="relationships-with-family">Relationships with family</h2>
				<p>With the <a href="https://instagram.com/p/2wgvYYpLx4/">Charleston</a> on the way, my relationship with Lauren is better than ever, and we’re working hard to prepare for the challenge ahead.</p>
				<p>I could definitely do better with my family. I’m not good about picking up the phone and calling my siblings (or anyone for that matter). If I don’t have a specific reason to call, I usually don’t. I’d really like to change that. </p>
				<h2 id="responsible-use-of-goods-and-resources">Responsible use of goods and resources</h2>
				<p>I’ve definitely been able to make some strides here. Having a decent waste &amp; recycling company is a big reason why. I don’t even put the trash out every week because it frequently has one or no bags in it. That said, I would still like to find ways to waste less through composting and buying fewer unrecyclable products.</p>
				<p>I’ve recently adjusted how I take showers. I generally keep them on the luke warm to cool side. I never turn the handle more than halfway. Not only does it use less energy heating water, but I don’t feel the need to just stand in the shower so I take shorter, more efficient showers. I’ve also switched to using a homemade toothpaste so hopefully I’m creating a little less waste there.</p>
				<p>I’ve been working hard to reduce the amount of stuff in our home, but I’ve got a long way to go there. I’m slowly tossing or giving away things that I don’t need. But I’m still clinging to a large number of old Eagles jerseys…</p>
				<h2 id="care-of-my-body">Care of my body</h2>
				<p>This has largely been a failure this year. I’ve gotten very little exercise. I’ve not played much basketball or tennis like I wanted to. I’m trying to pay attention to what I eat, but I’ve mostly been passive. I tend to rely on Lauren to plan healthy meals, which she does very well. The good news is she usually does the grocery trips, so I’m not able to pick up a bunch of junk food. I don’t drink much soda anymore. I haven’t been to the doctor, which I desperately need to do.</p>
				<p>It’s not all bad news. Things are on the uptick with my fitness. I got back to scheduling my days (which is absolutely crucial to my productivity, more on that soon). And I’ve run every single day this week. I’m keeping my goals simple, but consistent. I want to run one mile every single day for a month. It’s quick and (mostly) easy, but it’s building a habit that should help me stay consistent. One of the things I’m looking at doing is using <a href="https://diy.soylent.com">Soylent</a> to replace some of the times in the week where I would eat crappy meals, or no meal at all.</p>
				<h2 id="serve-participate-in-community">Serve &amp; Participate in Community</h2>
				<p>Almost nothing but failure. There are only a couple of small positives I can think of. I went to a local monthly Cocoa Heads meetup, but unfortunately I’ve missed the two since that one. I’ve also started following the RSS feed for the <a href="http://knoxvillecitytn.iqm2.com/Citizens/Default.aspx">Knoxville City Council minutes</a>. It’s small, but it helps me keep a little bit up to date on what’s going on in the city. </p>
				<p>The good news is Lauren and I have found a church we really enjoy, but we need to get plugged into the community there. We have plenty of friends in Knoxville, many that we <em>love</em>, but we don’t really feel like we have a community. That’s something we want to work on.</p>
				<h2 id="use-electronics-responsibly">Use electronics responsibly</h2>
				<p>I’m not even sure what to say on this one. I don’t think I sussed it out well enough to properly evaluate myself. My rule of no electronics after 10 PM has not been a success. I’ve barely even thought about it. I’m going to work on making that an actual part of my day. I have a feeling it will be a little easier once Charleston comes.</p>
				<h2 id="relationship-with-god">Relationship with God</h2>
				<p>I think I’ve done a pretty crummy job here. I haven’t done anything to serve God in the community. I haven’t been regularly praying (other than at meals) or reading the bible. I haven’t talked about God with other communities outside of church.</p>
				<p>I think now that I’m back to intentionally scheduling my day, I’ll get in the habit of scheduling some time for God. Some prayer and bible reading time every day would be good. I also have been thinking about getting back to having a physical bible. If anyone has any recommendations they would be appreciated.</p>
				<hr>
				
				<p>So that’s where I am. If I can find some time soon, I might try to refine my manifesto and put the full version on the internet. What’s the point of having a guiding document if you can’t be held accountable? As I mentioned earlier, I’m doing more intentional planning of my daily work. I’d like to write about exactly what that looks like.</p>

						<blockquote>
				<p>When we call someone misogynist or racist or sexist or a capitalist, a socialist or an abstract expressionist, what are we hoping for? Every one of us is on the &#39;ist&#39; spectrum, so the label becomes meaningless. Meaningless labels are noise, noise that lasts.</p>
				<p>If that person stopped acting like a <strong>_</strong>ist, what would change? Because if there&#39;s nothing we want to change, the labeling is useless. And if there&#39;s a change that needs to be made, let&#39;s talk about what it is.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is something that absolutely drives me nuts about our sort of shock culture. Someone does or says something, we label them, and as Seth Godin also says…</p>
				<blockquote>
				<p>The best reason to brand someone with a pejorative label is to push them away, to forestall useful conversation, to turn them into the other.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>It divides our culture all over the place. We want to find the racists, and the sexists, and whatever else-ists, label them and cast them out rather than looking at them as people, digging into the issues, and trying to figure out how we can help them and ourselves. Applying such vitriolic labels is tremendously oversimplifying people who are much more complex. Yes someone made a sexist or racist remark, and lets deal with that and talk about it. But let’s not reduce them as a person down to that comment. </p>
				<p>Empathy is needed all around. Empathy for other groups of people. Empathy for those with a poor understanding of other groups. Just general empathy for people who are different.</p>

				<p>Distractions, excuses, and challenges will always be right at your doorstep.</p>
				<p>Don’t wait for the fear to go away, because it won’t.</p>
				<p>Don’t wait for the risk to disappear, because there will always be risk.</p>
				<p>Show up every day when it’s frightful. When it’s risky. When it’s tense. When it hurts. Because it will always be that way — the “finally” moment never comes.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is such an easy trap to slip into. I feel the pull of it every day. Once I launch <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a> maybe people will know about me and I’ll <em>finally</em> feel good about myself as a developer. Once I’ve saved enough to buy the home I want, I’ll <em>finally</em> feel at rest. </p>
				<p>We love to hope. Because hope is awesome. No matter how good or bad the current moment is, hope says the next one will be better. And that’s pretty exciting. But that hope can easily turn into something insatiable in unpleasant forms like greed and workaholism. The key is to embrace the fears and challenges and find joy in them. Find joy in the every day struggle and keep working and find satisfaction in resting and looking back on a day’s work.</p>
				<p>It’s this reason that I’m super intrigued by Shawn Blanc’s <a href="https://thefocuscourse.com">Focus Course</a>. There are a lot of video series/courses/cat videos/minecraft hacks on the internet dedicated to improving yourself, but I have to think Shawn’s is the best. It’s not about making a million bucks before you’re thirty, or how you can hack your body to run 5 marathons a year. It’s simply about how diligence and focus can be learned to do more meaningful work.</p>

				<p>So even though we have the technical ability to deliver cheap, super-fast internet and we have the financial ability to finance the construction, we don&#39;t actually have the network. In fact, we&#39;re so in hock to the interests of the broadband incumbents that we don&#39;t even use all the fiber networks we&#39;ve already built.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Basically cable companies are putting their money towards lobbying to shut down possible competition rather than investing in better, faster infrastructure. </p>
				<p>More local governments should look at <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/innovation/chattanooga-internet/index.html">Chattanooga</a> as an example and try to emulate that success. A smallish city building such a fast network for such affordable prices is a huge warning sign that the private internet sector is broken.</p>

				<p>I still think this is a fairly long way off. I don’t know many people outside the tech-ish bubble who would even consider it. I support the move, as you know exactly what you’re paying for and when you’re paying for it.</p>

				<p>T-Mobile’s already made this shift, factoring an installment cost of the phone into its plan price. When you pay off the phone, your plan gets cheaper. So if you decide to stick with your current phone for a while, you save money. Likewise, if you bring your own phone, you don’t pay the higher rate. If you want to switch to another provider, just pay off the cost of the phone, and you’re free to go—no pesky contracts mucking things up.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>AT&amp;T does something similar. I moved Lauren and I both off contract by paying the full price of our phones last year (it’s amazing how stunned the reps at the AT&amp;T store were by this). That move dropped our bill by about $15 per line. Just this month I upgraded us to the 10GB data plan and that upped our discount to $25 per line every month. That clever bit of pricing  makes anyone using more than 3GB heavily motivated to move up to the bigger plans. If you use that much data, you can actually save money by paying full price up front and taking advantage of the bigger discount.</p>

						<p>A while back I <a href="/a-change/">wrote</a> about a revamp to the how my site was deployed. Naturally, I’m a tinkerer, and I couldn’t resist making more changes. <a href="http://www.hexo.io">Hexo</a> is a really nice website scaffolding, but there’s a <em>lot</em> to it. If I wanted to get in and mess around I had to do a lot of digging. I wanted to have a better understanding of how things were constructed.</p>
				<p>I’ve been working for a long while on a node based server/generator called Clive that not only generates a site, but gives you an admin interface for editing and publishing files. It also has the ability to queue up posts for automatic posting and generation. I spent some time away from it, and just don’t love it. It’s another thing that just does too much.</p>
				<p>So for the past week or so I’ve been all over the internet trying to figure out how I want to build this website in a way that makes it easy for my to share and write the way I want to. I finally settled on what I find to be the simplest process; setting up a Gulp build &amp; deploy system.</p>
				<p>At some point in the near future I’ll open source it (and Clive for that matter). But for now the basics of my setup are this…</p>
				<ul>
				<li>All posts and pages and whatever else I might create are written in markdown</li>
				<li>Content is stored in two folders, called <code>published</code> and <code>drafts</code> (mostly for ease in combing through and editing files)</li>
				<li>Actual published state is stored via a boolean value in the front matter</li>
				<li>I have a couple of tasks which will sort through the markdown files and move any out of place files into their correct directory</li>
				<li>Site is generated with handlebars templates. It’s not great but in order to keep links to previous posts from breaking I’ve set up redirect pages with meta tags which send you to the proper location.</li>
				<li>Styles are in a single less file that’s compiled to css during the build</li>
				</ul>
				<p>My next task is to use <a href="http://www.nodegit.org/">nodegit</a> to automate deploying to Github pages. I know, I could write more if I spent less time tinkering, but I want to do some of both. I’m hoping I’ll be happy with this as a long term solution…</p>

				<p>For years, I have preached the same message to successful products of the NFL’s farm system: Leave as quickly as you can if there’s a living to be made or even if you’re on the cusp of making one. Playing football for the price of a degree is not a worthwhile trade.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>So much truth in here. I’ve spent too much time thinking oh this or that guy could have improved their draft stock by staying in school. But it’s crap. Many of these guys are tremendously under compensated for their skills and sacrifice. Once your skills are at all desired in the NFL, I say go and finish that degree later.</p>
				<p>Honestly I’m just glad to see that more players are starting to say no to the millions of dollars to focus on life outside of football. Get what you can get. Quit while you’re ahead. Budget wisely. Don’t destroy the rest of your life for a few more years in the spotlight making millions.</p>
