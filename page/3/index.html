				<p>We are our first users — we’re using the workflows and environment that we set up for ourselves to make good decisions on behalf of ourselves, our families, our clients, and our users. We know the consequences of decision fatigue and poor choices better than most. We’re never going to eliminate decision fatigue from our own lives, or from anyone else’s, but by changing our own habits and lessening our own decision fatigue, we can make better choices more consistently throughout the day, which leads to a better experience for everyone.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about decision fatigue lately and how it might affect me. I’m trying to get to the more important things as early in the day as possible.</p>

				<p>It turns out that the most certain thing this windfall bought him was some heavy soul-searching. The only thing he has learned for sure: He was right to walk away from Minecraft. In explaining his recent decisions, he quotes Leonardo da Vinci: “Art is never finished, only abandoned.”</p>

				<p>This seems to be becoming a depressingly common story. Guy or girl creates something cool or popular. Gets an uncomfortable amount of hate over how they manage it. Checks out. Lucky for Persson it netted him well north of a billion dollars. But no amount of money makes that kind of hate feel any better.</p>
				<p>As I think about the small possibility of <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a> being really successful, I do get a little terrified. But my ability to ignore the internet has increased greatly in the past couple of years. I won’t mind if it’s a problem I have to deal with.</p>

				<p>The star exploded more than nine billion years ago on the other side of the universe, too far for even the Hubble to see without special help from the cosmos. In this case, however, light rays from the star have been bent and magnified by the gravity of an intervening cluster of galaxies so that multiple images of it appear.</p>
				<p>Four of them are arranged in a tight formation known as an Einstein Cross surrounding one of the galaxies in the cluster. Since each light ray follows a different path from the star to here, each image in the cross represents a slightly different moment in the supernova explosion.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>The way light, gravity, and time work at this scale is absolutely fascinating and mind bending.</p>

				<p>The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits mandate that anything sold as bourbon must be:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Made from a grain mixture (the mash) that is at least 51% corn.</li>
				<li>Aged in new, charred oak barrels.</li>
				<li>Distilled to no more than 160 proof, or 80% alcohol.</li>
				<li>Entered into a barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof, or 62.5% alcohol.</li>
				<li>Bottled at 80 proof or more, at least 40% alcohol.</li>
				<li>Made in the United States.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Notice that, although most bourbon is from Kentucky and it’s known as Kentucky’s whiskey, bourbon doesn’t have to be made in Kentucky at all. It can be made anywhere in the United States. Nevertheless, many bourbons made outside of Kentucky choose not to call themselves bourbon, like Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels is, by definition, a bourbon whiskey, but they market themselves as Tennessee Whiskey.</p>

				<p>I had always thought that bourbon whiskey had to be made in Kentucky.</p>

				<p>I find myself more and more interested in urban design. Having lived most of my life in Knoxville and Orlando, I’m very used to cities built for cars. But there are parts of each city that are becoming more pedestrian friendly. Those parts are really my favorite places to be.</p>
				<p>For me it’s a tough balance. I really want to be in those areas, but I also want to live on a nice big chunk of greenery</p>

				<p>Are you willing to be foolish in order to do work that matters? Are you willing to fail? To be honest with others? Are you willing to create something even when life is still messy? Are you willing to take risks? Are you willing to put your work out there even when you’re afraid it might not work? Are you willing to try something different than what everyone else is doing because your gut says “why not”? Are you willing to make space in your schedule so you can show up and create something every day?</p>
				<p>In our heart, we say, “Yes!” Then we tell ourselves we’ll start tomorrow.</p>
				<p>Most of us want to do work that matters. But most of us don’t want to be foolish. At least, not right now. Or, we’re okay with being foolish so long as it’s calculated, planned out, polished, and then distilled down to the lowest common denominator until it’s so insipid it couldn’t possibly be confused as foolishly original.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>It was really appropriate that I read this last night, because it really echoes what I’ve been thinking about for the past few weeks. I’ve been mulling over a job offer as we unpack into our new home. What I really want to do is take the risk and spend a couple month’s working full time on <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a>. But it’s a huge risk. Lauren’s income will be limited until she can get more clients.</p>
				<p>It’s not just the financial risk that concerns me, it’s what everyone else thinks. I try so hard to only answer to God and my wife. If someone doesn’t like what I’m doing, then that’s their problem. But it’s hard not to hear family constantly saying “but it’s a job” and feel like it’s what I <em>should</em> do. </p>
				<p>I may not have another shot to take this risk. The App Store is a tough place to be successful. I have so many doubts and fears, but I badly want to make a run at it. In a few months I may be desperate for a job, and I’m ready to deal with that if we get there. I haven’t <em>quite</em> made a final decision but I will soon. And regardless I will continue to be open to the right job offer if it comes along. For now, I might just be ready to be foolish.</p>
