		  <p>The star exploded more than nine billion years ago on the other side of the universe, too far for even the Hubble to see without special help from the cosmos. In this case, however, light rays from the star have been bent and magnified by the gravity of an intervening cluster of galaxies so that multiple images of it appear.</p>
		  
		  <p>Four of them are arranged in a tight formation known as an Einstein Cross surrounding one of the galaxies in the cluster. Since each light ray follows a different path from the star to here, each image in the cross represents a slightly different moment in the supernova explosion.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>The way light, gravity, and time work at this scale is absolutely fascinating and mind bending.</p>

		  <p>The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits mandate that anything sold as bourbon must be:
		  - Made from a grain mixture (the mash) that is at least 51% corn.
		  - Aged in new, charred oak barrels.
		  - Distilled to no more than 160 proof, or 80% alcohol.
		  - Entered into a barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof, or 62.5% alcohol.
		  - Bottled at 80 proof or more, at least 40% alcohol.
		  - Made in the United States.</p>
		  
		  <p>Notice that, although most bourbon is from Kentucky and it’s known as Kentucky’s whiskey, bourbon doesn’t have to be made in Kentucky at all. It can be made anywhere in the United States. Nevertheless, many bourbons made outside of Kentucky choose not to call themselves bourbon, like Jack Daniels. Jack Daniels is, by definition, a bourbon whiskey, but they market themselves as Tennessee Whiskey.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>I had always thought that bourbon whiskey had to be made in Kentucky.</p>

		<p>I find myself more and more interested in urban design. Having lived most of my life in Knoxville and Orlando, I’m very used to cities built for cars. But there are parts of each city that are becoming more pedestrian friendly. Those parts are really my favorite places to be.</p>
		
		<p>For me it’s a tough balance. I really want to be in those areas, but I also want to live on a nice big chunk of greenery</p>

		  <p>Are you willing to be foolish in order to do work that matters? Are you willing to fail? To be honest with others? Are you willing to create something even when life is still messy? Are you willing to take risks? Are you willing to put your work out there even when you’re afraid it might not work? Are you willing to try something different than what everyone else is doing because your gut says “why not”? Are you willing to make space in your schedule so you can show up and create something every day?</p>
		  
		  <p>In our heart, we say, “Yes!” Then we tell ourselves we’ll start tomorrow.</p>
		  
		  <p>Most of us want to do work that matters. But most of us don’t want to be foolish. At least, not right now. Or, we’re okay with being foolish so long as it’s calculated, planned out, polished, and then distilled down to the lowest common denominator until it’s so insipid it couldn’t possibly be confused as foolishly original.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>It was really appropriate that I read this last night, because it really echoes what I’ve been thinking about for the past few weeks. I’ve been mulling over a job offer as we unpack into our new home. What I really want to do is take the risk and spend a couple month’s working full time on <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a>. But it’s a huge risk. Lauren’s income will be limited until she can get more clients.</p>
		
		<p>It’s not just the financial risk that concerns me, it’s what everyone else thinks. I try so hard to only answer to God and my wife. If someone doesn’t like what I’m doing, then that’s their problem. But it’s hard not to hear family constantly saying “but it’s a job” and feel like it’s what I <em>should</em> do. </p>
		
		<p>I may not have another shot to take this risk. The App Store is a tough place to be successful. I have so many doubts and fears, but I badly want to make a run at it. In a few months I may be desperate for a job, and I’m ready to deal with that if we get there. I haven’t <em>quite</em> made a final decision but I will soon. And regardless I will continue to be open to the right job offer if it comes along. For now, I might just be ready to be foolish.</p>

				<p>My last day at ESPN has finally arrived. It’s been a pretty incredible 3+ years for me. I moved from Knoxville to Seattle to Orlando. I’ve gotten married. I got cats...</p>
		
		<p>Now we move onto the next season of life and I’m filled with both excitement and terror. I’m excited to be moving home to the city that I <em>love</em> in Knoxville. But I’m taking a little bit of a plunge as I continue to search for the right job while I work on <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape/">Outshape</a> and keep sending <a href="http://chrisbrakebill.com/threethings/">Three Things Weekly</a>. It is terrifying. But I believe in myself, I have a wife who believes in me, and I trust God and I can’t wait to see what happens.</p>

				<blockquote>
		  <p>Voluntary simplicity, or simple living, is a way of life that rejects the high-consumption, materialistic lifestyles of consumer cultures and affirms what is often just called ‘the simple life’ or ‘downshifting.’ The rejection of consumerism arises from the recognition that ordinary Western-style consumption habits are degrading the planet; that lives of high consumption are unethical in a world of great human need; and that the meaning of life does not and cannot consist in the consumption or accumulation of material things. Extravagance and acquisitiveness are accordingly considered an unfortunate waste of life, certainly not deserving of the social status and admiration they seem to attract today. The affirmation of simplicity arises from the recognition that very little is needed to live well – that abundance is a state of mind, not a quantity of consumer products or attainable through them.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>This is a concept that has been on my mind a lot lately. As we plan our move and I see the amount of crap we accumulate, I can’t help but think we need a better strategy when it comes to the goods we acquire. When I was trying to write out a <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/02/13/how-and-why-to-write-your-own-personal-manifesto/">personal manifesto</a> in my journal, one of the things I landed on that was important to me was my use of goods and resources. Here are the bullet points:
		- Actively looking for ways to reduce my waste
		- Only keep things that are frequently useful, or which I like to look at
		- Think more carefully when acquiring new things about sustainability, utility, and aesthetic value</p>
		
		<p>This ‘simple living’ doesn’t mean buying cheap stuff. In fact, to me it means the opposite in many cases. I want to acquire <em>less</em> stuff, but I want it to be higher quality. I want to buy things that last and that I enjoy seeing in my home.</p>
