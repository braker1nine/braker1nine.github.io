				<p>Distractions, excuses, and challenges will always be right at your doorstep.</p>
				<p>Don’t wait for the fear to go away, because it won’t.</p>
				<p>Don’t wait for the risk to disappear, because there will always be risk.</p>
				<p>Show up every day when it’s frightful. When it’s risky. When it’s tense. When it hurts. Because it will always be that way — the “finally” moment never comes.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is such an easy trap to slip into. I feel the pull of it every day. Once I launch <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a> maybe people will know about me and I’ll <em>finally</em> feel good about myself as a developer. Once I’ve saved enough to buy the home I want, I’ll <em>finally</em> feel at rest. </p>
				<p>We love to hope. Because hope is awesome. No matter how good or bad the current moment is, hope says the next one will be better. And that’s pretty exciting. But that hope can easily turn into something insatiable in unpleasant forms like greed and workaholism. The key is to embrace the fears and challenges and find joy in them. Find joy in the every day struggle and keep working and find satisfaction in resting and looking back on a day’s work.</p>
				<p>It’s this reason that I’m super intrigued by Shawn Blanc’s <a href="https://thefocuscourse.com">Focus Course</a>. There are a lot of video series/courses/cat videos/minecraft hacks on the internet dedicated to improving yourself, but I have to think Shawn’s is the best. It’s not about making a million bucks before you’re thirty, or how you can hack your body to run 5 marathons a year. It’s simply about how diligence and focus can be learned to do more meaningful work.</p>

				<p>So even though we have the technical ability to deliver cheap, super-fast internet and we have the financial ability to finance the construction, we don&#39;t actually have the network. In fact, we&#39;re so in hock to the interests of the broadband incumbents that we don&#39;t even use all the fiber networks we&#39;ve already built.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Basically cable companies are putting their money towards lobbying to shut down possible competition rather than investing in better, faster infrastructure. </p>
				<p>More local governments should look at <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/20/technology/innovation/chattanooga-internet/index.html">Chattanooga</a> as an example and try to emulate that success. A smallish city building such a fast network for such affordable prices is a huge warning sign that the private internet sector is broken.</p>

				<p>I still think this is a fairly long way off. I don’t know many people outside the tech-ish bubble who would even consider it. I support the move, as you know exactly what you’re paying for and when you’re paying for it.</p>

				<p>T-Mobile’s already made this shift, factoring an installment cost of the phone into its plan price. When you pay off the phone, your plan gets cheaper. So if you decide to stick with your current phone for a while, you save money. Likewise, if you bring your own phone, you don’t pay the higher rate. If you want to switch to another provider, just pay off the cost of the phone, and you’re free to go—no pesky contracts mucking things up.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>AT&amp;T does something similar. I moved Lauren and I both off contract by paying the full price of our phones last year (it’s amazing how stunned the reps at the AT&amp;T store were by this). That move dropped our bill by about $15 per line. Just this month I upgraded us to the 10GB data plan and that upped our discount to $25 per line every month. That clever bit of pricing  makes anyone using more than 3GB heavily motivated to move up to the bigger plans. If you use that much data, you can actually save money by paying full price up front and taking advantage of the bigger discount.</p>

						<p>A while back I <a href="/a-change/">wrote</a> about a revamp to the how my site was deployed. Naturally, I’m a tinkerer, and I couldn’t resist making more changes. <a href="http://www.hexo.io">Hexo</a> is a really nice website scaffolding, but there’s a <em>lot</em> to it. If I wanted to get in and mess around I had to do a lot of digging. I wanted to have a better understanding of how things were constructed.</p>
				<p>I’ve been working for a long while on a node based server/generator called Clive that not only generates a site, but gives you an admin interface for editing and publishing files. It also has the ability to queue up posts for automatic posting and generation. I spent some time away from it, and just don’t love it. It’s another thing that just does too much.</p>
				<p>So for the past week or so I’ve been all over the internet trying to figure out how I want to build this website in a way that makes it easy for my to share and write the way I want to. I finally settled on what I find to be the simplest process; setting up a Gulp build &amp; deploy system.</p>
				<p>At some point in the near future I’ll open source it (and Clive for that matter). But for now the basics of my setup are this…</p>
				<ul>
				<li>All posts and pages and whatever else I might create are written in markdown</li>
				<li>Content is stored in two folders, called <code>published</code> and <code>drafts</code> (mostly for ease in combing through and editing files)</li>
				<li>Actual published state is stored via a boolean value in the front matter</li>
				<li>I have a couple of tasks which will sort through the markdown files and move any out of place files into their correct directory</li>
				<li>Site is generated with handlebars templates. It’s not great but in order to keep links to previous posts from breaking I’ve set up redirect pages with meta tags which send you to the proper location.</li>
				<li>Styles are in a single less file that’s compiled to css during the build</li>
				</ul>
				<p>My next task is to use <a href="http://www.nodegit.org/">nodegit</a> to automate deploying to Github pages. I know, I could write more if I spent less time tinkering, but I want to do some of both. I’m hoping I’ll be happy with this as a long term solution…</p>

				<p>For years, I have preached the same message to successful products of the NFL’s farm system: Leave as quickly as you can if there’s a living to be made or even if you’re on the cusp of making one. Playing football for the price of a degree is not a worthwhile trade.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>So much truth in here. I’ve spent too much time thinking oh this or that guy could have improved their draft stock by staying in school. But it’s crap. Many of these guys are tremendously under compensated for their skills and sacrifice. Once your skills are at all desired in the NFL, I say go and finish that degree later.</p>
				<p>Honestly I’m just glad to see that more players are starting to say no to the millions of dollars to focus on life outside of football. Get what you can get. Quit while you’re ahead. Budget wisely. Don’t destroy the rest of your life for a few more years in the spotlight making millions.</p>

				<p>Here’s how the scheme works. Facebook approaches a telco—in India’s case, Reliance—and offers to pay them the bandwidth costs of serving Facebook site and a small group of other sites.</p>
				<p>So when the poor, who in theory can’t afford a net connection come to the Facebook Zero service confusingly called Internet.org, they’re made to believe they’re on the internet while in reality they’re only on Facebook and a few hand-picked sites.</p>
				<p>And the sites too are picked in secret under some unknown process. For instance, Facebook chose to offer the distant-second search engine Bing instead of industry-leading Google. Why? Is it rivalry with Google? Or because of Microsoft’s stake in Facebook? And then Facebook’s Zero product features a tiny job site like Babajob instead of the industry-leading Naukri. Why? So that the poor have fewer job options? No one knows. Facebook doesn’t feature YouTube—the largest video site in the world and an immense education resource —but allows its own videos in full. It doesn’t really look like charity any more, does it? </p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>While zero services are a more extreme case and don’t fit what you will see in the U.S., they are helpful in illustrating how the seemingly good idea of certain companies’ products not counting towards your data caps is actually bad for the internet. You’re no longer choosing between product X and product Y. It’s now product X, which won’t count towards you cap, and product Y, which may be a superior product but can’t afford to pay off your internet provider. Your cell phone company or ISP shouldn’t get to make this decision. They should simply give you uniform access to sites on the internet and charge you according to that usage, no matter where it comes from.</p>

						<p>If you didn’t know, I’d been looking to trade my iPhone 6+ in for an iPhone 6. I was recently able to sell my 6+ on Glyde. Since my last sale fell through, I decided to wait this time until I had the money before buying a new phone. Some crazy slow shipping times, combined with a seller who didn’t seem to want to part with their iPhone 6 left me without a smartphone for about 3 weeks. I feel like the experience of having a phone which was only for calling has been really informative of my habits. (Okay it could text, but have you tried texting without a full keyboard? It’s horrific).</p>
				<p><img src="/images/oldPhone.jpg" alt="My awesome Alcatel temp phone"></p>
				<p>It became apparent very quickly how habitual looking at my phone was. I would frequently look at my little candy bar for no reason at all. I needed a fix of stimulation that whatever situation I was currently in just couldn’t give me. Or so it seemed. As time went by, I found myself leaving my phone behind even as I went out to do things. I missed the occasional text or call, but for the most part being disconnected was a pleasure.</p>
				<p>One of the things I find interesting now is looking at my apps and thinking about how many of them I <em>need</em> on my phone. I’m pretty sure I can count on one hand the number of times I really needed an iPhone app for something. (One of those times was when I had to print out Google Maps directions and got lost. It felt like 2002 all over again). Most of the time I looked at my phone out of boredom or being stuck in unpleasant social situations (or both).</p>
				<p>I think the most revealing thing has been the past 48 hours of having an iPhone back in my life. I’d been anticipating getting it back for weeks. I think somewhere deep down I thought getting one back would make life so much easier or more pleasant or at least I’ll know the scores of every current SPORTING EVENT. But I’ve become a lot more conscious of my motivations every time I take a peek at it. And I’m finding myself putting it away because I really have nothing to do.</p>
				<p>So, is this experience going to change my life? Probably not. But at the very least it’s got me being a little bit more intentional about how I use my phone. I’m going to pare down the number of apps I keep on it and try to not feel like I need it everywhere I go.</p>
