						<p>A while back I <a href="/a-change/">wrote</a> about a revamp to the how my site was deployed. Naturally, I’m a tinkerer, and I couldn’t resist making more changes. <a href="http://www.hexo.io">Hexo</a> is a really nice website scaffolding, but there’s a <em>lot</em> to it. If I wanted to get in and mess around I had to do a lot of digging. I wanted to have a better understanding of how things were constructed.</p>
				<p>I’ve been working for a long while on a node based server/generator called Clive that not only generates a site, but gives you an admin interface for editing and publishing files. It also has the ability to queue up posts for automatic posting and generation. I spent some time away from it, and just don’t love it. It’s another thing that just does too much.</p>
				<p>So for the past week or so I’ve been all over the internet trying to figure out how I want to build this website in a way that makes it easy for my to share and write the way I want to. I finally settled on what I find to be the simplest process; setting up a Gulp build &amp; deploy system.</p>
				<p>At some point in the near future I’ll open source it (and Clive for that matter). But for now the basics of my setup are this…</p>
				<ul>
				<li>All posts and pages and whatever else I might create are written in markdown</li>
				<li>Content is stored in two folders, called <code>published</code> and <code>drafts</code> (mostly for ease in combing through and editing files)</li>
				<li>Actual published state is stored via a boolean value in the front matter</li>
				<li>I have a couple of tasks which will sort through the markdown files and move any out of place files into their correct directory</li>
				<li>Site is generated with handlebars templates. It’s not great but in order to keep links to previous posts from breaking I’ve set up redirect pages with meta tags which send you to the proper location.</li>
				<li>Styles are in a single less file that’s compiled to css during the build</li>
				</ul>
				<p>My next task is to use <a href="http://www.nodegit.org/">nodegit</a> to automate deploying to Github pages. I know, I could write more if I spent less time tinkering, but I want to do some of both. I’m hoping I’ll be happy with this as a long term solution…</p>

				<p>For years, I have preached the same message to successful products of the NFL’s farm system: Leave as quickly as you can if there’s a living to be made or even if you’re on the cusp of making one. Playing football for the price of a degree is not a worthwhile trade.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>So much truth in here. I’ve spent too much time thinking oh this or that guy could have improved their draft stock by staying in school. But it’s crap. Many of these guys are tremendously under compensated for their skills and sacrifice. Once your skills are at all desired in the NFL, I say go and finish that degree later.</p>
				<p>Honestly I’m just glad to see that more players are starting to say no to the millions of dollars to focus on life outside of football. Get what you can get. Quit while you’re ahead. Budget wisely. Don’t destroy the rest of your life for a few more years in the spotlight making millions.</p>

				<p>Here’s how the scheme works. Facebook approaches a telco—in India’s case, Reliance—and offers to pay them the bandwidth costs of serving Facebook site and a small group of other sites.</p>
				<p>So when the poor, who in theory can’t afford a net connection come to the Facebook Zero service confusingly called Internet.org, they’re made to believe they’re on the internet while in reality they’re only on Facebook and a few hand-picked sites.</p>
				<p>And the sites too are picked in secret under some unknown process. For instance, Facebook chose to offer the distant-second search engine Bing instead of industry-leading Google. Why? Is it rivalry with Google? Or because of Microsoft’s stake in Facebook? And then Facebook’s Zero product features a tiny job site like Babajob instead of the industry-leading Naukri. Why? So that the poor have fewer job options? No one knows. Facebook doesn’t feature YouTube—the largest video site in the world and an immense education resource —but allows its own videos in full. It doesn’t really look like charity any more, does it? </p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>While zero services are a more extreme case and don’t fit what you will see in the U.S., they are helpful in illustrating how the seemingly good idea of certain companies’ products not counting towards your data caps is actually bad for the internet. You’re no longer choosing between product X and product Y. It’s now product X, which won’t count towards you cap, and product Y, which may be a superior product but can’t afford to pay off your internet provider. Your cell phone company or ISP shouldn’t get to make this decision. They should simply give you uniform access to sites on the internet and charge you according to that usage, no matter where it comes from.</p>

						<p>If you didn’t know, I’d been looking to trade my iPhone 6+ in for an iPhone 6. I was recently able to sell my 6+ on Glyde. Since my last sale fell through, I decided to wait this time until I had the money before buying a new phone. Some crazy slow shipping times, combined with a seller who didn’t seem to want to part with their iPhone 6 left me without a smartphone for about 3 weeks. I feel like the experience of having a phone which was only for calling has been really informative of my habits. (Okay it could text, but have you tried texting without a full keyboard? It’s horrific).</p>
				<p><img src="/images/oldPhone.jpg" alt="My awesome Alcatel temp phone"></p>
				<p>It became apparent very quickly how habitual looking at my phone was. I would frequently look at my little candy bar for no reason at all. I needed a fix of stimulation that whatever situation I was currently in just couldn’t give me. Or so it seemed. As time went by, I found myself leaving my phone behind even as I went out to do things. I missed the occasional text or call, but for the most part being disconnected was a pleasure.</p>
				<p>One of the things I find interesting now is looking at my apps and thinking about how many of them I <em>need</em> on my phone. I’m pretty sure I can count on one hand the number of times I really needed an iPhone app for something. (One of those times was when I had to print out Google Maps directions and got lost. It felt like 2002 all over again). Most of the time I looked at my phone out of boredom or being stuck in unpleasant social situations (or both).</p>
				<p>I think the most revealing thing has been the past 48 hours of having an iPhone back in my life. I’d been anticipating getting it back for weeks. I think somewhere deep down I thought getting one back would make life so much easier or more pleasant or at least I’ll know the scores of every current SPORTING EVENT. But I’ve become a lot more conscious of my motivations every time I take a peek at it. And I’m finding myself putting it away because I really have nothing to do.</p>
				<p>So, is this experience going to change my life? Probably not. But at the very least it’s got me being a little bit more intentional about how I use my phone. I’m going to pare down the number of apps I keep on it and try to not feel like I need it everywhere I go.</p>

						<p>For those of you who don’t know, I’ve been spending most of my time since I left ESPN working on a game called <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a>. I’m getting super close to being ready to submit to the App Store. I’m just trying to iterate the design and interaction to as close to perfection as I can get it, while I smooth out some functional edges. It’s the most fun I’ve had in years. And I’m delighted to be able to work hard without having to work all night.</p>
				<p>I’ve started a <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape/blog">blog</a> where I’m going to document the development process of Outshape. From the inspiration, to early mocks, to the stresses of sharing a thing I’m making with the world. I’m sure some of that will come over here, but I’m going to post anything Outshape specific over there.</p>
				<p>So go sign up for the email list if you want to get the details on how Outshape came to be!</p>

						<p>It’s been interesting to read <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/4/well-i-switched-to-the-iphone-6-plus">Stephen Hackett</a>, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/04/06/life-with-the-iphone-6-plus">Marco Arment</a> and <a href="http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/04/two-weeks-with-the-iphone-6-plus/">Jason Snell</a> talk about their experiences as regular iPhone 6 users who are experimenting with or switching to the iPhone 6 Plus. Particularly since I’ve been a 6 Plus user who is switching to the regular ol’ iPhone 6. </p>
				<p>I don’t want to comment on their opinions much, since I don’t have my iPhone 6 yet and I don’t yet know how it works for me. My reason for switching boils down mostly to the fact that the 6 Plus is just too big. I may find that the 6 is too big in day to day usage as well. But I’m most worried about the drop in battery life. I got used to almost never having to think about the battery on my 6 Plus.</p>
				<p>I will definitely follow up with my experiences with the iPhone 6 when I receive it.</p>
