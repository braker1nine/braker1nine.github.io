        <blockquote>
<p>People are stuck inside the giant spider web that is the consumer society, which is built upon the idea of accumulating stuff, and they don’t even realize it. But let’s go to the beginning. When you buy something, make no mistake, the money is an instrument that you’re using to pay for it. But what you’re actually paying with is the time of your life that you had to spend in order to earn that money. So whenever you spend on something, what you’re really giving away is time, the time of your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This guy is fantastic. Exactly what government representatives should be.</p>
<p>In this piece, which almost feels like several pieces, Álvaro Serrano talks about the resource of time, geeks and their toys, the two week test, and buying stuff that lasts. Absolutely worth spending some time on.</p>

<p>Eliot’s early exposure to games with limited graphics inoculated him from the flashy, hyper-realistic graphics found in today’s AAA games. He can appreciate retro graphics on its own terms, and focus on the gameplay.</p>
<p>My hope is that this experiment instilled a life-long appreciation for smaller, weirder, more intimate games in him.</p>

<p>I’m worried that my child won’t understand how simple and yet how difficult games used to be before they were so… realistic. There’s something so magical about a game where you can see the pixels.</p>

        <p>Just for fun, I thought I would go through and simulate my playoffs as they would happen. I’m using <a href="http://www.ncaagamesim.com/fb_GameSimulator.asp" target="_blank" rel="external">this</a> fun little tool to simulate all of the games. I thought about simulating them multiple times to get a more accurate look at how the game would go, but what is college sports without the fun of how random it can be.</p>
<p>Up this week, we have round 1 of my two playoff versions. Let’s look at what happened…</p>
<p><hr></p>
<h3 id="12_Team">12 Team</h3><p><img src="/images/12_team_round1.png" alt="12 Team"></p>
<p>The 12 team bracket ended up with mostly chalk, but Georgia Southern pulled off a huge upset of Baylor in double OT.</p>
<p><hr></p>
<h3 id="16_Team">16 Team</h3><p><img src="/images/16_team_round1.png" alt="16 Team"></p>
<p>The 16 team bracket also saw Georgia Southern pulling off an overtime upset, this time against #1 Alabama. I like this playoff idea a little more every day.</p>

<p>It seems ridiculous that reviewing a bunch of headphones would bring this degree of controversy, but that wasn’t really the cause. I often speak and write with arrogance, absolutes, and generalizations that I don’t intend, and often don’t even realize I’ve done unless someone points it out. It’s probably the biggest flaw in my writing and personality, and while I’ve been trying to write (and think) with more qualifiers, fewer absolutes, and more consideration and inclusion of other viewpoints, I still have a long way to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve had this sitting in my queue for a while, but this is some fantastic and <em>real</em> self evaluation. I will fully admit to being annoyed my Marco’s ‘arrogance’ and ‘absolutes’ frequently. Despite the fact that we surely disagree on many things, I’ve always respected him and this just makes me respect him <em>way</em> more.</p>
<p>We (myself as much as anyone) could all use more open, honest looks at ourselves. And we would do well to share what we see with the people around us, because they’ve likely seen it and been affected by it.</p>

<p>A friend of mine told me that, when dealing with people, it’s best to assume positive intent. You can view it as a shortcut (since, truthfully, the vast majority of people do have positive intent), but more importantly it’s a conscious choice that makes the world a better place for you.</p>

<h2 id="date:_2014-03-25_18:47:21">date: 2014-03-25 18:47:21</h2><p>I’ve got several links and a few things to say about the Vols advancing to the Sweet 16. First off, I’m <strong>pumped</strong>. These players have all worked hard and deserve it. I loved seeing the energy we saw from Cuonzo Martin. I feel like we know him a little better.</p>
<p>Here’s a bit from an <a href="http://www.footballtime.com/2014/03/24/open-letter-cuonzo-martin/" target="_blank" rel="external">open letter</a> to Cuonzo Martin:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were blind to the type of leader you are. We were blind to the love your players have for you. We ignored the quiet work you do in the community—work you do because you care, not because you want to draw attention to yourself. We were blind to your growth as a coach and to your potential.</p>
<p>Yet, here you are in the Sweet 16 leading a team that might be the best story of the tournament. Here you are leading a group of young men who blocked out all our chatter, backed you, and embraced your coaching. You deserve a tremendous amount of credit for keeping this team together. Many coaches would have lost them when the criticism reached deafening levels, but not you. Instead, you got them playing together at just the right time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is great stuff and it’s absolutely true. I was someone who was salivating over the idea of <a href="http://chrisbrakebill.com/2014/02/25/bruce-pearl/" target="_blank" rel="external">Bruce Pearl coming back</a>. It wasn’t really fair to Cuonzo Martin.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts from <a href="http://www.tnsportsradio.com/2014/03/24/vol-nation-united-stand/" target="_blank" rel="external">Tennessee Sports Radio</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before this season, Martin had never led the Vols to the NCAA Tournament. That’s a fail, folks, and one need look no further than to Bruce Pearl’s six-year tenure as the Vols’ head coach for confirmation of such. A stretch during which the Tennessee Volunteers punched their ticket to the dance every single season. Three times they danced all the way to the Sweet 16, one of those tangos evolving into the program’s first and only Elite 8 appearance ever. Thanks to Bruce Pearl, NCAA Tournament appearances are now expected in Knoxville. And rightly so.</p>
<p>Which is why Cuonzo Martin came under ever increasing scrutiny this season. For he entered it 0-2 in the only stat that mattered. NCAA Tournament berths…</p>
<p>Therefore, many in Vol Nation believed Cuonzo Martin was a horrible coach. Bruce Pearl was a great one whose show-cause was just about to end. So 36,000 members of Vol Nation signed on the dotted virtual line and made it official. Time for the great coach to replace the horrible one.</p>
<p>The only problem with that is that Cuonzo Martin isn’t a horrible coach. Don’t get me wrong. He certainly hadn’t proven he was a great one. Not by any stretch. A great coach doesn’t put forth a team which underachieves as often as Martin’s team did this year. But calling Martin a horrible coach isn’t accurate, either. A horrible coach doesn’t win 60-plus games in three seasons. A horrible coach doesn’t land five-star recruits like Robert Hubbs III. A horrible coach doesn’t keep a team together when 36,000 fans have officially called for his head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This team looked <em>very</em> different a month ago. There wasn’t much they’d done to give us reason to expect they would play like this. Not consistently. I don’t think at that time you were wrong to think, maybe it’s time for a change back to Bruce Pearl. But this is why you wait until the <em>end</em> of the season to make decisions like this.</p>
<p>I also have confess to being swayed by the show that is Bruce Pearl. He’s enthusiastic. He paints his chest. He makes jokes about bacon. He promises to kick Florida’s ass, and delivers. </p>
<p>Cuonzo is a quiet guy. He doesn’t say more than he needs to. And I absolutely faulted him for that which is unfair. You don’t have to make a show of yourself to be a great coach (see: pretty much every other great coach). And we’ve always known he’s a great man. That’s why we followed up a coach who made questionable decisions with him.</p>
<p>Cuonzo still has a lot to prove. But he’s at the very least proven he can make a sweet 16. He’s got a good chance to do more than that. He’s going to have a challenge ahead next year, but he’s earned the security to show us what else he has up his sleeve. </p>
