			<p>Fantastic stuff from Spencer Hall. Every time I hear someone talk about how expensive the new Nike gear is, I get sick to my stomach. The amount of money being generated by college football that&#39;s being funneled to coaches, facilities, and administrators is absurd. Especially with everything we&#39;re learning about CTE. These guys are literally putting their lives on the line for room and board. I&#39;ll let Spencer wrap this up...</p>
			<blockquote>
			<p>Pay them. Pay them what you owe them. Pay them because the worst American tradition is taking things that aren&#39;t yours and calling it destiny or virtue or principle. Pay them because there is no nobility in keeping someone a dollar poorer than they have to be in exchange for honest work. Pay them because any system that deliberately makes people poorer is one of designed cruelty, even at this relatively small scale. Pay them their goddamn money.</p>
