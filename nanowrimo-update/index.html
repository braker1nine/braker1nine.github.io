					<p>Unfortunately it’s hard to call my attempt at NaNoWriMo anything but a failure. I wrote about 6 super short chapters of my “novel” and inertia plus the holidays stopped me in my tracks.</p>
			<p>The biggest problem I found each day was my fear before even getting started. I felt like I had already written a bunch of shit and all I could muster up was more of it. I also had this crippling fear of writing myself into a corner. Sticking myself in a position where my story was screwed. The point of NaNoWriMo is to power through this and if you don’t like your plot at the end, you can edit it. But I couldn’t fight off the fear that I was going to write something dumb (this not doing something for the fear that I’ll do it poorly is an all too common story in my life).</p>
			<p>I’m thinking about keeping the writing going throughout the year and maybe trying to add to the novel once a week. Nothing to ambitious. Just consistently sticking to the habit, if for nothing else but the habit’s sake.</p>
