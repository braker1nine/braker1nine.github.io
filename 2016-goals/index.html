					<p>Just like last year, I&#39;d like to take a look at some goals for this year. One of the things I&#39;m going to do with these is print them out somehow and post them in my office, by my bed, and maybe even stick a small version in my wallet. </p>
			<h3 id="less-watching-more-doing">Less Watching, More Doing</h3>
			<p>I <em>love</em> me some TV. And with the huge variety of content available through Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc., it&#39;s hard not to spend our nights glued to the TV. I&#39;d like to make that less of the default move in our home. I want to do more development. More reading. More writing. More crafts and projects. </p>
			<h3 id="settle-my-soul">Settle my soul</h3>
			<p>The past 5 years has been a whirlwind, going from Knoxville to Seattle to Orlando, and back to Knoxville. I&#39;ve never really moved in somewhere expecting it to be my home for more than a year. As we scout our next home around Downtown Knoxville, I want to find somewhere we expect to stay for at least a few years. I&#39;ve used not owning my home as a reason for not investing in a place, but I&#39;m going to get out of that mindset. I want to own a home at some point, but I&#39;m going to try hard to really settle myself wherever we end up next and make it <em>home</em> as much as I can.</p>
			<h3 id="take-care-of-my-body">Take care of my body</h3>
			<p>I didn&#39;t do well at this last year, but I&#39;m hopeful about this year. I&#39;m planning to start a morning routine that involves hitting the YMCA to play some basketball. I want to actually run at least one 5K this year. Lauren and I are both wanting to look more into how we can eat better this year. Less Jet&#39;s Pizza and more veggies.</p>
			<h3 id="mindfulness">Mindfulness</h3>
			<p>I know this sounds super wishy washy and vague, but hear me out. I don&#39;t often worry about <em>future Chris</em> as I do stuff around the house. For example, I&#39;m pulling something out of the spice cabinet. I ravage that thing looking for the right spice, and then toss it in, leaving myself open to the need for future ravagings (I&#39;m serious about my spices). I recently organized it a bit and what I&#39;d like to do is keep it easy to find what I&#39;m looking for. When I&#39;m done with my spices, I need to take the extra 10 seconds to put them in their place so <em>future Chris</em> has things easier.</p>
			<p>I want to practice a sort of <em>mise en place</em> for all sorts of things in my everyday life. Doing so will help keep the house in order and make me a better worker and just a better me.</p>
			<h3 id="grow-my-own-food">Grow my own food</h3>
			<p>My mom has a great garden which she pulls basil, peppers, and tomatoes from. She does it all on her deck. It&#39;s time to stop letting being a renter prevent me from investing in a garden. Lauren and I both want to do this so I want to make this the year we start it. Beyond food, I want more plants around the house. We don&#39;t keep many, mostly because we tend to kill them. I want to fix that.</p>
			<h3 id="seek-god">Seek God</h3>
			<p>Read my bible. Go to church. Pursue Christ-filled relationships with people. I&#39;ve gotten way too passive with my faith and my relationship with Christ in the past few years. 2016 should be a year of action.</p>
			<h3 id="release-outshape">Release Outshape</h3>
			<p>I know right? When is this guy just going to give up? Never. I used to have this goal of releasing it and having it be super successful and letting me keep working on my own things. I&#39;ve really detached myself from how successful Outshape is. I want to create this thing that I&#39;m proud of and release it. If I can do that, I will feel good about the work I put into it.</p>
			<h3 id="start-a-podcast">Start a podcast</h3>
			<p>I&#39;m keeping this one because I really want to do this. It&#39;s sort of silly, but I just love podcasts and would love to sit around and talk with some friends about something and share it with others. Not every goal has to be huge.</p>
			<h3 id="deepen-relationships">Deepen relationships</h3>
			<p>Building a bit on my goal to call people from 2015. More than just calling people, I want to talk to them more. I want to spend more time discussing real stuff and putting myself out there. I want to text less. Conversation is vulnerability. Texting is often just information passing.</p>
			<h3 id="take-up-less-space">Take up less space</h3>
			<p>This covers several things. Continuing to produce less waste. Compost more and buy more things that are recyclable. Continuing to reduce the amount of clutter in my house. If I don&#39;t keep a gift you give me it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t appreciate it. I absolutely do. But if I don&#39;t use it frequently or find it pleasant to look at, I just can&#39;t keep it. And that&#39;s okay. The use of a gift isn&#39;t what matters. It&#39;s the love and relationship the <em>giving</em> of the gift represents.</p>
			<hr>
			
			
			<p>So there it is. Those are the ten things I really want to focus on in 2016. Looking back at the list, it seems clear that I want to spend more time doing and I want to be a better steward of my time and my resources. Here&#39;s to hoping I can meet my goals in 2016 better than in 2015.</p>
