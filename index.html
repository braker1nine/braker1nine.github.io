					<h1 class="post__title"><a href="/2016-goals/">2016 Goals</a></h1>
					<h2 class="post__date">January 6th, 2016</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>Just like last year, I&#39;d like to take a look at some goals for this year. One of the things I&#39;m going to do with these is print them out somehow and post them in my office, by my bed, and maybe even stick a small version in my wallet. </p>
				<h3 id="less-watching-more-doing">Less Watching, More Doing</h3>
				<p>I <em>love</em> me some TV. And with the huge variety of content available through Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc., it&#39;s hard not to spend our nights glued to the TV. I&#39;d like to make that less of the default move in our home. I want to do more development. More reading. More writing. More crafts and projects. </p>
				<h3 id="settle-my-soul">Settle my soul</h3>
				<p>The past 5 years has been a whirlwind, going from Knoxville to Seattle to Orlando, and back to Knoxville. I&#39;ve never really moved in somewhere expecting it to be my home for more than a year. As we scout our next home around Downtown Knoxville, I want to find somewhere we expect to stay for at least a few years. I&#39;ve used not owning my home as a reason for not investing in a place, but I&#39;m going to get out of that mindset. I want to own a home at some point, but I&#39;m going to try hard to really settle myself wherever we end up next and make it <em>home</em> as much as I can.</p>
				<h3 id="take-care-of-my-body">Take care of my body</h3>
				<p>I didn&#39;t do well at this last year, but I&#39;m hopeful about this year. I&#39;m planning to start a morning routine that involves hitting the YMCA to play some basketball. I want to actually run at least one 5K this year. Lauren and I are both wanting to look more into how we can eat better this year. Less Jet&#39;s Pizza and more veggies.</p>
				<h3 id="mindfulness">Mindfulness</h3>
				<p>I know this sounds super wishy washy and vague, but hear me out. I don&#39;t often worry about <em>future Chris</em> as I do stuff around the house. For example, I&#39;m pulling something out of the spice cabinet. I ravage that thing looking for the right spice, and then toss it in, leaving myself open to the need for future ravagings (I&#39;m serious about my spices). I recently organized it a bit and what I&#39;d like to do is keep it easy to find what I&#39;m looking for. When I&#39;m done with my spices, I need to take the extra 10 seconds to put them in their place so <em>future Chris</em> has things easier.</p>
				<p>I want to practice a sort of <em>mise en place</em> for all sorts of things in my everyday life. Doing so will help keep the house in order and make me a better worker and just a better me.</p>
				<h3 id="grow-my-own-food">Grow my own food</h3>
				<p>My mom has a great garden which she pulls basil, peppers, and tomatoes from. She does it all on her deck. It&#39;s time to stop letting being a renter prevent me from investing in a garden. Lauren and I both want to do this so I want to make this the year we start it. Beyond food, I want more plants around the house. We don&#39;t keep many, mostly because we tend to kill them. I want to fix that.</p>
				<h3 id="seek-god">Seek God</h3>
				<p>Read my bible. Go to church. Pursue Christ-filled relationships with people. I&#39;ve gotten way too passive with my faith and my relationship with Christ in the past few years. 2016 should be a year of action.</p>
				<h3 id="release-outshape">Release Outshape</h3>
				<p>I know right? When is this guy just going to give up? Never. I used to have this goal of releasing it and having it be super successful and letting me keep working on my own things. I&#39;ve really detached myself from how successful Outshape is. I want to create this thing that I&#39;m proud of and release it. If I can do that, I will feel good about the work I put into it.</p>
				<h3 id="start-a-podcast">Start a podcast</h3>
				<p>I&#39;m keeping this one because I really want to do this. It&#39;s sort of silly, but I just love podcasts and would love to sit around and talk with some friends about something and share it with others. Not every goal has to be huge.</p>
				<h3 id="deepen-relationships">Deepen relationships</h3>
				<p>Building a bit on my goal to call people from 2015. More than just calling people, I want to talk to them more. I want to spend more time discussing real stuff and putting myself out there. I want to text less. Conversation is vulnerability. Texting is often just information passing.</p>
				<h3 id="take-up-less-space">Take up less space</h3>
				<p>This covers several things. Continuing to produce less waste. Compost more and buy more things that are recyclable. Continuing to reduce the amount of clutter in my house. If I don&#39;t keep a gift you give me it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t appreciate it. I absolutely do. But if I don&#39;t use it frequently or find it pleasant to look at, I just can&#39;t keep it. And that&#39;s okay. The use of a gift isn&#39;t what matters. It&#39;s the love and relationship the <em>giving</em> of the gift represents.</p>
				<hr>
				
				
				<p>So there it is. Those are the ten things I really want to focus on in 2016. Looking back at the list, it seems clear that I want to spend more time doing and I want to be a better steward of my time and my resources. Here&#39;s to hoping I can meet my goals in 2016 better than in 2015.</p>

					<h1 class="post__title"><a href="/a-look-back-at-2015/">Look Back at 2015</a></h1>
					<h2 class="post__date">January 5th, 2016</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>At the beginning of the year I wrote about a <a href="https://chrisbrakebill.com/what-i-want-to-do-better-in-2015/">few things</a> I wanted to improve upon in 2015. I just want to take a look back at those and see how I feel like I did. We did have a baby this year so... this could get ugly.</p>
				<h3 id="dental-hygiene">Dental Hygiene</h3>
				<p>I would say I&#39;m doing better here but not great. Been having some pain lately so I think it&#39;s time to go to the dentist (okay fine it&#39;s long past time to go). I&#39;ve  been flossing and using mouthwash regularly. I think I&#39;ve set myself up for major improvement here in 2015.</p>
				<h3 id="exercise">Exercise</h3>
				<p>This is a big bucket of fail. I had some good stretches of consistent running. But it broke down a bit in the summer. Being back in Tennessee is definitely going to make this tougher to improve upon in the winter. Not much tennis and basketball either in 2015. Lauren and I recently joined a program with our insurance that gives us access to many gyms around Knoxville (YMCA&#39;s in particular) so I&#39;m hoping we can get going with this.</p>
				<h3 id="journaling">Journaling</h3>
				<p>I did a lot of this in the first half of the year, but I dropped off later on. Particularly once the baby came. I&#39;m thinking I might try to pick this up again in 2015. I liked the prompt I did early last year. I might try to find something similar this year.</p>
				<h3 id="releasing-outshape">Releasing Outshape</h3>
				<p>😞 I&#39;m getting there. I made some great progress while I was between jobs. But it&#39;s hard to help raise a baby, work a full time job, <em>and</em> engage in a side hustle.</p>
				<h3 id="minimalism">Minimalism</h3>
				<p>This one I&#39;m feeling pretty good about. There&#39;s a lot of room to grow but I&#39;ve gotten fairly ruthless about not keeping stuff I don&#39;t love or need. Now if I could just attack my wife&#39;s 3/4 of the closet...</p>
				<h3 id="recycling-waste-reduction">Recycling/Waste Reduction</h3>
				<p>Another place I feel like I&#39;ve really improved. Having a local recycling service has been the biggest part. We&#39;re sending more stuff into recycling than we are the trash. I&#39;ve replaced a lot of incandescents with LED bulbs. The phrase &quot;just because I can doesn&#39;t mean I should&quot; has been circling my head lately with respect to the resources I use.</p>
				<h3 id="improve-my-relationship-with-lauren">Improve my relationship with Lauren</h3>
				<p>I think we&#39;ve made strides here. Having a baby has been an amazing experience as a couple. Challenging for sure. But it&#39;s definitely made us both feel more like a team.</p>
				<h3 id="go-to-church">Go to church</h3>
				<p>I&#39;m really happy with where we are here. We&#39;ve found a church in Knoxville that we love. We&#39;re in a community group there so we&#39;re getting to know some awesome people there. I hope we can continue to grow there in 2016.</p>
				<h3 id="read-my-bible">Read my Bible</h3>
				<p>Another fail. I need a new Bible this year.</p>
				<h3 id="read-more-in-general">Read more in general</h3>
				<p>I think I did more of this but it all kind of runs together. There are a few books I remember loving, I&#39;m just not sure if they were 2015 or 2014. I&#39;m gonna try to do a better job keeping track in Goodreads. It&#39;s hard to find time with a baby (this is a common theme).</p>
				<h3 id="fewer-screens">Fewer Screens</h3>
				<p>There&#39;s good and bad here. We spend a <em>lot</em> of time still watching TV. But I&#39;ve made some strides in reducing my phone use. I&#39;ve deleted a good number of apps and I&#39;m trying to break that instinctual need to just look at my phone. Just enjoyed a two week break from work for Christmas, and I feel like I barely looked at a computer screen. So hooray for that.</p>
				<h3 id="call-people">Call People</h3>
				<p>👎 Another place I failed. This one has been on my mind lately and it will definitely be something I hope to improve upon in 2016.</p>
				<h3 id="start-a-podcast">Start a podcast</h3>
				<p>Nope. I still want to do this. I&#39;m just not sure where I will fit it in. And I need to get my buddies all in on it.</p>

						<p>Taking a try at something new over the next week or two. I&#39;m gonna stay off Twitter completely. I&#39;m just wondering whether the time and thought I invest there is wasted.  </p>
				<p>I&#39;m also gonna try to leave my phone in my car or out of sight more in social situations. I&#39;ve had a lot on my mind about just how my phone (and digital communication in generally) is impairing me socially.</p>

					<h1 class="post__title"><a href="/2015-playoff/">2015 College Football Playoff</a></h1>
					<h2 class="post__date">December 8th, 2015</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p><a href="https://chrisbrakebill.com/the-real-college-football-playoff/">Last year</a> I presented my idea for a better playoff. I&#39;ve tweaked it a little this year to add a 14 team option instead of 16 team. Basically it&#39;s 4 rounds, conferences champions all get automatic bids, with a couple of at-large teams.</p>
				<h2 id="conference-champions">Conference Champions</h2>
				<p>First things first, let’s look at who is getting the automatic bids into our tournament.</p>
				<table>
				<tr><td>AAC</td><td>Houston</td></tr>
				<tr><td>ACC</td><td>Clemson</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Big XII</td><td>Oklahoma</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Big Ten</td><td>Michigan State</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Conference USA</td><td>Western Kentucky</td></tr>
				<tr><td>MAC</td><td>Bowling Green</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Mountain West</td><td>San Diego State</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Pac 12</td><td>Stanford</td></tr>
				<tr><td>SEC</td><td>Alabama</td></tr>
				<tr><td>Sun Belt</td><td>Arkansas State</td></tr>
				</table>
				
				<h2 id="at-large-spots">At Large Spots</h2>
				<p>So we’ve got 10 conference champions that leaves us 2 or 4 at large spots, depending on the playoff format.</p>
				<p>I&#39;m not even going to bother trying to make my own rankings here. The playoff committee goes deep enough to use <a href="espn.go.com/college-football/rankings/_/poll/21/seasontype/2/year/2015/week/15">their rankings</a> to determine who makes the playoff. Adding a couple of extra teams here so you can see who just misses out on making the playoff.</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Iowa</li>
				<li>Ohio State</li>
				<li>Notre Dame</li>
				<li>Florida State</li>
				<li>North Carolina</li>
				<li>TCU</li>
				</ol>
				<h2 id="ranking-the-field">Ranking the Field</h2>
				<p>So that gives us our field of 12 to 14 teams. Mostly based on CFP rankings, and doing it myself for some of the lower seeded teams.</p>
				<table>
				<thead>
				<tr><th>14 Team</th><th>12 Team</th></tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
				<tr><td>1. Clemson</td><td>1. Clemson</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2. Alabama</td><td>2. Alabama</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3. Michigan State</td><td>3. Michigan State</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4. Oklahoma</td><td>4. Oklahoma</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5. Iowa</td><td>5. Iowa</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6. Stanford</td><td>6. Stanford</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7. Ohio State</td><td>7. Ohio State</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8. Notre Dame</td><td>8. Houston</td></tr>
				<tr><td>9. Florida State</td><td>9. Bowling Green</td></tr>
				<tr><td>10. Houston</td><td>10. San Diego State</td></tr>
				<tr><td>11. Bowling Green</td><td>11. Western Kentucky</td></tr>
				<tr><td>12. San Diego State</td><td>12. Arkansas State</td></tr>
				<tr><td>13. Western Kentucky</td><td></td></tr>
				<tr><td>14. Arkansas State</td><td></td></tr>

				<p>Fantastic stuff from Spencer Hall. Every time I hear someone talk about how expensive the new Nike gear is, I get sick to my stomach. The amount of money being generated by college football that&#39;s being funneled to coaches, facilities, and administrators is absurd. Especially with everything we&#39;re learning about CTE. These guys are literally putting their lives on the line for room and board. I&#39;ll let Spencer wrap this up...</p>

				<p>Pay them. Pay them what you owe them. Pay them because the worst American tradition is taking things that aren&#39;t yours and calling it destiny or virtue or principle. Pay them because there is no nobility in keeping someone a dollar poorer than they have to be in exchange for honest work. Pay them because any system that deliberately makes people poorer is one of designed cruelty, even at this relatively small scale. Pay them their goddamn money.</p>

					<h1 class="post__title"><a href="/routine-update/">Update to my morning routine</a></h1>
					<h2 class="post__date">July 24th, 2015</h2>
					<div class="post__content">
						
						<p>In my <a href="/morning-routine/">previous post</a> about my morning routine, I said my ability to stick to it when I&#39;m not home varied. I&#39;d like to update that and say that on my trip to Victoria for our <a href="https://opdbrooks.exposure.co/metalab-summit">MetaLab Summer Summit</a> last week my routine completely fell apart. </p>
				<p>Fortunately, I don&#39;t think it was a failure of the routine, and more a failure of my own. I just wasn&#39;t intentional about keeping it up and making sure it was important enough to attend to every day. I don&#39;t think I realized just how important that structure was, because without it everything feels completely out of order and I feel so unproductive. So I&#39;m already thinking about how I can handle it better the next time I travel, and it will mostly involve being intentional and having a plan for how to adjust my routine to the new location rather than just playing it by ear.</p>
				<p>The next big test or change for my routine comes in about two months when <a href="http://charleston.brakebill.me">Charleston</a> comes into the world. No doubt I&#39;m in for big changes and will have to make some more adjustments for her.</p>

						<p>As you can tell, I&#39;ve slowed my posting down a bit here. I&#39;m reducing my time spent focused on writing for the time being. As I&#39;m ramping up at <a href="http://metalab.co">MetaLab</a>, I have less time to work on <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a>. I&#39;m trying to focus as much time as I can on getting Outshape out the door, which leaves less time for writing. </p>
				<p>Rest assured, I&#39;ll still be posting infrequently and I&#39;ve got some plans to do more microblogging here (and slow myself down when it comes to hot takes on Twitter). </p>

				<p>The often cited rule is that the hardest part of any task is starting. When you move to another work area you do so with a plan of what you are doing. So when you arrive at that workstation you start doing that work. And you’ve now just accomplished the “hardest” part of most tasks.</p>

				<p>I haven’t tried out any sit/stand desks, but I have gone back and forth between having a standing and a sitting desk in my office. I’ve found that having only one option is suboptimal. As Lauren and I talk about our future home, one of the things I want in my office is multiple places to work, one standing and one sitting, so I can move back and forth as needed.</p>
