<p>Shawn Blanc likes to say that those who work with their minds, rest with their hands. It’s something I absolutely believe in. Even throughout the day on a micro level, I take brief work rests to clean the kitchen, vacuum the living room, or sift through the horror that is the litter box.</p>
<p>Shawn likes to do woodworking when he is resting. It’s a hobby I would love to get into one day, but right now I don’t have the money, space, or tools to do it.</p>
<p>I have discovered a different but applicable hobby in barbecue. Not only do I enjoy the labor I put into it, but the fruits (well, meats) I get out of it are quite delicious. In the past month, I’ve spent two of my Saturdays seasoning meat, soaking wood chips, and keeping my smoker at a consistent low heat.</p>
<p><img src="/images/barbecue/raw_pork.jpg" alt="Pork Butt"></p>
<p>One of the beauties of barbecue is it gives you a lot of time to relax. You have to pay attention to your smoker and the temperature, but it’s a <em>long</em> process and there’s a lot of waiting time. You can read a book, drink a beer, finally beat that level on TwoDots, write a letter to your representative, relax in the sun, etc etc etc.</p>
<p><img src="/images/barbecue/outside_thermometer.jpg" alt="Drinking Coffee and waiting..."></p>
<p>Another great thing about barbecue is there’s a lot of freedom and creativity. You can spice it up however you want. Want to make it sweet? You can do that. Want to put sriracha on it? You can do that. Want to soak your ribs in Dr. Pepper? You can do that. There are so many ways to achieve different flavors. It’s almost an art form (but really it’s science).</p>
<p>While I love hacking away, I’m really excited to have a fun hobby that doesn’t involve me staring at my computer. There’s something so relaxing about spending my Saturday working in the sun. I’m already planning on doing a rack of ribs for my next smoke…</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes in Meteor you need to use the same helper across templates. For example, if you have several views with admin controls, you might want a helper to help you control who sees those. It would be a pain to add that function to each template. Luckily, Meteor provides the ability to create a new global helper via UI.registerHelper.</p>
<p>UI.registerHelper takes two parameters: the name of the helper as a string, and the function to be called. So to add my admin helper I might do something like this.</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre>UI.registerHelper(<span class="string">'admin'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
	<span class="keyword">return</span> userIsAdmin();
});
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>UI.registerHelper is an excellent tool to prevent repeating code and to centralize global template functionality.</p>

<p>To be made for eternity and forced to dwell in time is for mankind a tragedy of huge proportions. All within us cries for life and permanence, and everything around us reminds us of mortality and change. Yet that God has made us of the stuff of eternity is both a glory and a prophecy, a glory yet to be realized and a prophecy yet to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>This thought is a major comfort when I’m overwhelmed with a desire for permanence and an aversion to death or change.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Fantastic</em> writing from Brian Phillips. I’ll be honest I watched a maximum of 30 minutes of non-US soccer during the World Cup. Even then, I didn’t watch the Belgium game. Soccer isn’t my game, but I’ll do just about anything that let’s me drink and be patriotic.</p>
<p>That said, this is a fantastic commentary of the significance of sport. Or really the significance of how we watch them. Here’s the opening, no way you can read this and not read the article.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watching sports is, among other things, a special way of experiencing time. Sport is like music or fiction or film in that, for a predetermined duration, it asks you to give it control over your emotions, to feel what it makes you feel. Unlike (most) forms of art, though, a game has no foreordained plan or plot or intention. The rules of a game impose a certain kind of order, but it’s different from the order of an artwork. A movie knows where it wants to take you; no one can say in advance where a game will go. All of its beauty, ugliness, boredom, and excitement, all of its rage and sadness emerge spontaneously out of the players’ competing desires to win. For however long the clock runs, your feelings are at the mercy of chance. This happens and then this happens and then this happens. You’re experiencing, in a contained and intensified way, something like the everyday movement of life.</p>

    <updated>2014-07-14T13:14:51.000Z</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m trying to create a decently designed JavaScript function that, when passed a function, returns (you guessed it) a function that runs some authentication code before trying to execute the passed in function. So the return function would look something like this…</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">createAuthedFunction</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
	<span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">(variable, numberOf, params)</span> {</span>
		<span class="keyword">if</span>(checkAuth()) {
			callPassedInFunction(variable, numberOf, params);
		}
	}
}
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Obviously I could just call checkAuth in every function that requires it, but that seems very non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#39;t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY</a> to me. What I’ve ended up going with is this:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">checkAuthFunction</span><span class="params">(func, error)</span> {</span>
  <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span><span class="params">()</span> {</span>
		<span class="keyword">if</span> (checkAuth()) {
			func.apply(<span class="keyword">this</span>, <span class="built_in">arguments</span>);
		} <span class="keyword">else</span> {
			error = error || <span class="string">'You must be an admin to do that.'</span>;
			console.log(error)
		}
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Now when an object or function wants to create a method that requires authentication to run, it calls checkAuthFunction and passes in a function (and an optional error message) and this returns a function that checks for proper authentication, and either runs the function or outputs an error message, depending on authentication status. Function.apply allows me to call the passed in function with the current this value and the passed in arguments.</p>
<p>It’s working for now, but I’m still not in love with it syntactically.</p>

<p>This is something I’ve become a lot more aware of in the past couple of years.
