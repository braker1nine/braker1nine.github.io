	  <p>Are you willing to be foolish in order to do work that matters? Are you willing to fail? To be honest with others? Are you willing to create something even when life is still messy? Are you willing to take risks? Are you willing to put your work out there even when you’re afraid it might not work? Are you willing to try something different than what everyone else is doing because your gut says “why not”? Are you willing to make space in your schedule so you can show up and create something every day?</p>
	  
	  <p>In our heart, we say, “Yes!” Then we tell ourselves we’ll start tomorrow.</p>
	  
	  <p>Most of us want to do work that matters. But most of us don’t want to be foolish. At least, not right now. Or, we’re okay with being foolish so long as it’s calculated, planned out, polished, and then distilled down to the lowest common denominator until it’s so insipid it couldn’t possibly be confused as foolishly original.</p>

	<p>It was really appropriate that I read this last night, because it really echoes what I’ve been thinking about for the past few weeks. I’ve been mulling over a job offer as we unpack into our new home. What I really want to do is take the risk and spend a couple month’s working full time on <a href="http://onehundredten.co/outshape">Outshape</a>. But it’s a huge risk. Lauren’s income will be limited until she can get more clients.</p>
	
	<p>It’s not just the financial risk that concerns me, it’s what everyone else thinks. I try so hard to only answer to God and my wife. If someone doesn’t like what I’m doing, then that’s their problem. But it’s hard not to hear family constantly saying “but it’s a job” and feel like it’s what I <em>should</em> do. </p>
	
	<p>I may not have another shot to take this risk. The App Store is a tough place to be successful. I have so many doubts and fears, but I badly want to make a run at it. In a few months I may be desperate for a job, and I’m ready to deal with that if we get there. I haven’t <em>quite</em> made a final decision but I will soon. And regardless I will continue to be open to the right job offer if it comes along. For now, I might just be ready to be foolish.</p>
